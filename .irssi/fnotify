Kady hey andy
Kady im alright
Kady you
Kady sounds like fun
CJ sudo nano /etc/rcS.d/S80bootmisc.sh
Kady got big plans for new years?
CJ Inside the last line of the function do_start()
CJ Put this: su -c '/home/dmsuperman/bin/start-screens-detached' -l dmsuperman
CJ Replace dmsuperman in both instance with your username
Kady why not
Kady do you have a facebook
Kady your going home for new years
CJ Then for that ~/bin/start-screens-detached, put this into the file: http://pastebin.com/d252f79fd
CJ And chmod +x the file to make it executable
CJ That expects you to have ~/.screenrc-start-detached, which you need to put this in that: http://pastebin.com/d43709df9
CJ Those are just misc options, you really don't need anything except the last 5 lines
Kady that sounds fun.... holidays with the family
Kady i just added you as a friend
Kady im at my boyfriends house
Kady mom and i are fighting
Kady blah

Kady and rotc
Kady out of all the classes i had to take i fail the easy freshmen level class lol
Kady next semester is algorithms..(which i HATE)..software engineering .. theater and some other crap classes i need to get my general education
CJ gedit ~/bin/reattach
CJ Put this: http://pastebin.com/d6862cf6e
CJ chmod +x ~/bin/reattach
CJ Then go into gnome-terminal, edit, profiles
CJ Create 2 profiles
CJ 1 called "im"
CJ 1 called "rtorrent"
CJ Do whatever you like with them, but give them an initial title, something like "IM" and for Dynamically-set title, change it to "Isn't displayed"
CJ Then, in ccsm, go to "Place Windows", under the Fixed Window Placement, add 2 new Windows with fixed potisions
CJ Make the rule something like: (class=Gnome-terminal) & (title=IM)
CJ But use the title you set instead of IM
CJ Set the X position and Y position to whatever you like, probably 0, 24
CJ Then for the bottom half, under Windows with fixed viewport, do the same thing, and set them on the proper workspace you like (where X=3, Y=1 means third workspace in the first row)
CJ And lastly, if you want to force them to be maximized, go to the Window Rules plugin, and next to Maximized put that same rule you had earlier (for each additional title, add another | title=rtorrent or whatever
CJ My window rule match is: (class=Gnome-terminal & (title=IM | title=IRC | title=rtorrent | title=mutt))

Sis can't win them all
Sis this guy and girl best friends graduate grad school, and he decides to tell her that she's the beneficiary of his living will blah blah blah

Sis his dad's in bad health
Sis his crazy step mom's tearing down everything
Sis and changing everything
Sis now the girl and his brother are banning together with her aunts (they were all like children to the aunts) to stop the crazy stepmother
Sis who didn't follow any of his will and such

Sis cause she's got nothing else to read
Kim :P
Kim you just are
Kim i thought you were leaveing
Kim ok
Kim oh ok
Kim no
Kim just you said you were leaving so yeh
Sis hey
Sis good
Sis playing games
CJ Word.
Sis cool
Sis have fun
CJ I don't run it in a new screen session :S
CJ Yesterday you mean?
CJ No, not really
CJ A while back is not "tomorrow"
CJ :P
CJ But no, not really
CJ You can't run GUI apps in screen
CJ screen server?wtf you talking about?
Sis hey, read my fb status lately?
CJ No
CJ Just have it always output and turn off the TV :S
CJ But yeah using place windows you could place it over on the TV
CJ Yeah, don't open anything on that screen :S
CJ On arbitrary monitors perhaps, never arbitrary screens
CJ There is a difference
CJ Call them what they are
CJ Because when you said "screen server" you were talking about yet another thing
CJ Which is the tabbed server that you're running rtorrent and irssi inside of
CJ Call what
CJ I just described everything :P
Sis yeah, wanna know how big my list for the year is now?
CJ 19:12 <dmsuperman> Yeah, don't open anything on that screen
CJ Right, but what you meant were arbitrary monitors
CJ Then I said
CJ 19:13 <dmsuperman> On arbitrary monitors perhaps, never arbitrary screens
CJ My left 2 monitors are 1 screen
CJ My right 2 monitors are 1 screen
CJ If I open something on my left screen, it can never open on my right screen
Sis 51
CJ Right
CJ Monitors are not screens necessarily
Sis those are books i hope to read, bu dont'  count any i just take off the library shelves, like the one i'm reading now. lol
CJ Make sure your TV is on it's own screen
CJ Then when you go to open XBMC, open it with DISPLAY=:1 xbmc
CJ That runs it on the second screen
Sis those were my countdowns to finish my book
Sis right
Sis what are you talking about
Sis cause kevin said he was getting weird ones too
Sis and i was sending them to you both
Sis oh, yeah, reece felt like typin on my computer
Sis and you're aim was up
Sis that's what that was about sorry bout that
CJ You have 1 screen afaik
Sis i did threten that once
CJ If you're using the same setup as you were when you were here
Sis but no i wasn't drunk last night, or the night last week when i drank
CJ You have 1 screen spanned across 2 monitors using TwinView
Sis yes she did
Sis in her house, with her family, on xmas eve while opening presents, it wasn't enough alcohol to do anything so no biggy
CJ Yup
Sis it was some vodka mixed with 7up and something else in a slushie
CJ Your video cards only have 2 RAMDACs, so you can't output to 2 Monitors + a TV
Sis you freakd about as much as kevin did
CJ So for a third one you need a second card
CJ Then go into nvidia-settings, enable that monitor (using Xinerama this time)
CJ So your final setup should be:
CJ 3 Monitors, Xinerama enabled
CJ Monitors 1 & 2 as one X Screen, spanned using TwinView
CJ And monitor 3, the TV, as one X Screen, by way of Xinerama
CJ So then your ultimate setup would be one X session, 2 screens
CJ I was wrong about :1 earlier
CJ You would launch XBMC with DISPLAY=:0.1 xbmc
Sis kev was like OMG you did waht?
Sis lol
Sis i'm always in ohio
Sis i don't leave
Sis i meant to say dover earlier
Sis but anyway, the last time i left ohio um, colorado summer 07
Sis i think
Sis no, i went to pennsylvania for a day trip last winter break
Sis hopefully, to arizona
CJ Heh
CJ Yeah
CJ fucking win
CJ Found my windows XP disc
Sis we'll see
Sis applications come in like late february or early march
CJ I've had this for almost 2 years
CJ I've never used the license
CJ I just keep using that XP 8-in-1 disc
CJ It doesn't even have 9
CJ Because it fails
Sis yeah, we'll see
Sis but thanks
CJ What about bandwidth
CJ Will it run fine through the PCI bus?
CJ Ah
CJ Same question still though
CJ wtf
Sis going downstairs, don't know when i'll come back
Sis around the house
Sis bye bro
Sis around the house
CJ Cut him
CJ Get 3x750GB and a good RAID controller instead :D
CJ Why not
CJ I didn't say RAID mirror
CJ RAID stripe with parity
CJ You only lose a little bit of space
CJ And it runs faster
CJ At the very least Seagate Barracuda
CJ If you're going to not RAID
CJ Those last forever, at just about the same price as the competition
CJ If you're going to do a NAS then you'd be foolish not to use RAID
CJ Oh well
CJ Yay KVM
CJ Much better than VirtualBox
CJ It runs as yet another daemon
CJ Separating something else from X
CJ You run it as a daemon, it runs right at the kernel level, so much faster
CJ And then you VNC to it
CJ But it's a "hardware" VNC
CJ You VNC to the VM hardware, so you don't need to have VNC on the VM
CJ I'm installing now
CJ In most cases, by some tests I was reading, it runs windows at near-host-hardware speeds
CJ As if you were running it normally
CJ The only difference is that like videos don't quite work as well without a special extension to the VNC setup
CJ Because they're run over the network (albeit staying localhost to localhost)
CJ K
CJ penis.
CJ usb
CJ 480mbps theoretical throughput
CJ vs 100
CJ aye
CJ but only if it's gigabit all the way
CJ NIC -> Router -> NIC
CJ You also have to think about if you're talking about for copying files
CJ With USB you have to double the time, copy to drive, copy to destination
CJ Yeah that would be fast, but then it wouldn't necessarily called NAS
CJ Since it's not really attached to the Network :P
CJ Then it would be slow
CJ Also fail
CJ :P
CJ And if your computer were down
CJ Then so would be the storage
Sis back
Sis around the house
Sis sure about what
Kim hi
Kim how are you?
Sis check aim status
Kim i'm ok
Sis no now
Kim you havn't asked for cam in a while lol

Caitlyn ooops

CJ drives*
Caitlyn I didn't mean ot put that.
Caitlyn have to much on mind lol
CJ Probably not
CJ I generally don't buy a "tide me over" setup though
CJ It's a waste
Caitlyn Im nicer though i love giving more hugs when im drunk and such though 
CJ Save for the good thing, or decide never to use the good thing
CJ You don't really need either what?
CJ Who said anything about external drive?
CJ I was suggesting internal RAID 5
CJ :P
Caitlyn Yah you have....well you been around a couple times when i was drinking.  I was never drunk though
Caitlyn buzzed yes
CJ And?
CJ And?
CJ SATA ports are irrelevant to RAID
CJ You need a RAID controller for RAID
CJ That has the ports
CJ I WANT TACOS
CJ Hows what supposed to work?
Sis haha
Sis thanks
CJ What extra drives :S
Caitlyn :-( its all locked still
Caitlyn oohh maybe halo

Sis relocating, just a min
Sis back
Kim hi
Kim how are you
Kim i'm ok
Kim when do you go back to school?
Kim ok
Kim j.w
Kim :P\
CJ How much total?
CJ wtf 7GB?
CJ what a random ass number
CJ Can you even use 7GB?
CJ Oh you're using 64bit right
CJ I'm thinking about getting a GTX 260 or a 9800 GTX+
CJ It's not even out yet
CJ I never planned on getting a $500 card
Kim sorry, i was eating
CJ That's just foolish
Kim ok
CJ CHRIST my fucking computer is getting hammered
Kim nothing
CJ I have a multi-gig DB
CJ a dump of our signature site-tracking product
CJ like google analysis but better
CJ analytics rather
CJ anyway, I just queried this table with tens of millions of records
CJ My home machine is fine, which is why I could talk to you
CJ But here it was getting so hammered I couldn't open a terminal
CJ So when it caught up 50 terminals came up at once :P
CJ Never heard ofi t
CJ what is it
CJ lame.
CJ :P
CJ Isn't it a windows-based phone
CJ Windows and nice terminal don't coexist
CJ The best windows client is PuTTY
CJ And that sucks ass
CJ It doesn't support unicode worth a damn :(
CJ bearable*
CJ If it can't do unicode or proper scrolling it pisses me off
CJ If not, good find :)
Kim why
Sis hey, i didn't mean to leave you ealier
Sis i was just really stress, and decided to go invisible
Sis dinner
Sis ppl
Sis amanda doing damage control on everyone and not on herself
Sis no, cassie and i are find
Sis fine
Sis well not fine, but we're good
Sis i'm ok
Sis i just decided that i need to take the rest of break and just get away from eerything
Sis i don't tell other pople my problems because i know i can take care of that and still help everyone else out
Sis it's just how i've always been, others before me
Sis anyway, i've got to go to canton, so i'll ttyl
Sis out till later, idk for sure
Sis i'm ok, i just need to take the rest of break and relax and recharge for school
Sis i know
Sis and thanks
Sis but hey, i'll ttyl
Sis bye bro
Kim :P\
Kim hi
Kim nothing
Kim sure
Kim i'm tired and waiting by the phone
Kim :S ok
Kim for adam to call when his delivery is done
Kim yeh
CJ So wtf arey ou gonna do with 7GB of RAM?
CJ You realize everything slows down the the slowest DIMM
Kim he got off work 55 min ago but he had to do a delivery in Niagara Falls and that usually takes a while
CJ So if you have inequal speeds then the slower one drags everything else down
CJ Nice
CJ 3200?
CJ Ah
CJ You'll _never_ use it then
CJ I could see using it when you use it as a heavyduty workstation running VMs
CJ I only use 4GB because I have preload amped way the fuck up and I use a VM 24/7
CJ Neither of which would be used on a server
CJ A waste :(
CJ It's ECC?
CJ I'm on my N800 in class
CJ Money better spent on desktop memory
CJ I'm still tossed up between a GTX 260, 9800GTX+, and a PS3
CJ You aren't using it all
CJ A majority of it goes to cache, linux will use almost all the memory you throw at it
CJ Check user memory usage, not system
CJ I'm not saying anything bad about it, I'm just trying to edmucate you
CJ Did you ever install preload?
CJ sudo apt-get install preload
CJ It is a waste, but I was done saying anything about that once I said it
CJ Preload learns what you load a lot and preloads it
CJ Like windows prefetch but into memory instead of that random ass drive folder
CJ yeah
CJ you doooooon't need to config anything
CJ shitty bluetooth kbd
CJ occasional hiccups :P
CJ oh noes teacher said laptops are for notes only :(o
CJ new laptop?
CJ no i can type without looking so she doesn't really notice
CJ ah
CJ and i'll take notes as well ;)p
CJ right
CJ aww
CJ fail
CJ see ya
CJ i will noobeh
CJ i'm borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrred
CJ and that wasn't a typo
CJ loligators
CJ alrighty
CJ aight den
CJ you ourght not talk like that
CJ you just a boy
CJ see ya
Kim bye
Sis around the house, might be near a computer, idk for sure. 
Sis hi!
Sis good, just got u
Sis up
Sis nm, gonna shower eventually then it's taking down xmas decorations
Sis and cleaning
Sis it was good
Sis went to my great aunt's
Sis heather's spending the week there, so we really just chilled
Sis yea
Sis i had a bad day, got a little stressed and mad and just needed to get away, so i signed off and started cleaning
Sis it's all good
Sis you had nothing to do with it, so don't worry
Sis it's not even school yet and i've already got like 37 things on my mind, and i just snapped yesterday for a bit. that's all
Sis i really just don't wanna talk about it. sorry
Sis i know
Sis thanks
Sis yea
Sis so i was freezing last night
Sis and i came down stairs and the thermostat said it was 66 in teh house
Sis i want my school room back it's always hot
Sis thanks
Sis lol
Sis well i'm off to work around the house, so i'll still be on, just here and there
Sis taking down xmas decoration
Sis s
Sis ok, then i'll just ttyl
Sis bye bro
Sis haha i beat you
Sis bye
CJ hey
CJ The blowguns
CJ How are they constructed
Kim hi
CJ I'm not here right now
CJ Dhrrdrdr
CJ What size pipe
CJ What type etc.
CJ Hwhite
CJ Or gray
CJ HWHITES OR GRAYS NOOBEH
CJ Neato
CJ Fucking fuckity fuck
CJ God damn intrepid
CJ Work on my PC
CJ Oh, fucking joy
CJ It's a bug in X
CJ Which you can't upgrade
CJ X is frozen in Ubuntu
CJ It received an update in Intrepid and there are no plans of upgrading for Jaunty yet
CJ So it'll be a full 9 months at least before I can upgrade Ubuntu
CJ Which also rules out mono-2.0, which is all the sweet apps
CJ Like docky, which is a gnome-do based dock which actually is supposed to own f'ing face
Kay het
Kay i remember who u are ur andy
Kim hi
Kim yeh
Kim ?
Kim mhm
Kim how are you?
Kim tired
Kim idk
Kim what?
Kim why
Kim ok, your an odd one
Kim lol
Kim yeh but i know why
Kim yeh but i do lol
Kim lol
Kim how do you figure?
Kim i'm not saying
Kim lol
CJ Hurray! Got a raise!
Sis I am away from my computer right now.
Sis kitchen work brb
Sis kk
Sis good
Sis you?
Sis normal voice
Sis and witha  smile
CJ So it took some doing
Sis no, like an 'amanda had a good day' smile
Sis uea
Sis yea
CJ But KVM works fantastically now
CJ I wanted it perfect, now it's better than Vbox
CJ Yup
CJ Basically, how it works now
CJ I scripted it out
CJ I just run "guest-kvm"
CJ It starts up the VM in the background
CJ Then when I hear the login noise then I know it's all done loading
CJ So I type "guest" and it uses windows remote desktop to rdesktop into the machine
CJ Which gives me the best mouse and keyboard performance
CJ I'm still working on video playback, because that sucks over rdesktop
CJ I'm thinking about switching it to vnc instead for that reason
CJ But it grabs its own IP from my router
CJ As far as my router knows, it has 2 machines connected to it
CJ But it's yet another thing detached from my X session, it runs as a daemon and I can rdesktop to it from anywhere
CJ I'll forward a port to it
CJ Which means I'll be able to test stuff in windows from a remote machine if I need an outside source, or just really anything
CJ :O photoshop from school
Sis how's andy
CJ Since August 13th, 2008, it's only the fifth time I've ever said it to you
Sis nice
CJ Yet another reason why grep owns face
CJ Hahha
CJ That was intentional
CJ Today
CJ Oh
CJ Whatevs
Sis i'm about to go back up to my tornado of a room
Kay hey
CJ Er, ok
CJ A lot of things in the English language are useless and redundant
CJ A lot of things in any language that humans speak are useless and redundant
Kay what up
Sis i'm currently (well like 1230-130pm earlier and then here in a bit) cleaning out last semesters notebooks and folders
Kay nuthin just got home 
CJ No, that's not a word
Kay u?
Sis and deciding what to keep and what to toss
CJ It's just as pointless as "yet another" but they're both not that pointless
Sis hence, tornado
Kay hows life been treating you
Sis papers are everywhere
Kay nice
CJ There's a reason you'd say "some way or another" vs just saying "some way"
Kay where you partying
Kay ??
CJ It puts more emphasis on the fact that you will settle for an alternative option if you must
Kay did u party at kent or something
Kay oh thats cool 
Kay i dont like kent main
Kay kent geauga
CJ This entire conversation is pointless
CJ You could have saved yourself many keystrokes by not saying anything
Kay bc its not my thing out there 
CJ Yet you did
CJ So it shows that you aren't _that_ interested in ensuring you save time and become more efficient
Kay noi really dont where is that at
CJ You're OCD then
CJ :P
Sis lol
Sis sorry, talking with mom 
Kay oh i never go out that way the only time i travel is when im showing horses
Kay great my horse is better than ever 
Kay wait wat
Kay lol yea
Kay i no ive been doing stuff for school and everyone else
CJ Gah
CJ I fucking hate linux users
CJ I have question A
Kay i mite be gone to cancun wit the bf
CJ So they all respond with answers to question b, c, and d
Kay my bf turns 21 next week
CJ Rather than help me out they offer alternatives to my entire choice of programs and protocols or whatever
Kay how am i lucky
CJ I use vbox, have issues, they suggest kvm
Kay so whats new with you?
CJ Then I go to kvm, they suggest vbox, when I turn that down, and ask specifically the best server and client for remote desktop between XP and Ubuntu
CJ They continue to offer options
CJ So I have to lie
Kay lol yea we probally wont go illprobally be showing
CJ I'm like: "I have 2 machines. One runs XP, one runs Ubuntu. I want to watch something that can remote desktop to XP and let me watch a netflix movie in IE which only works in Windows"
Kay lol noo i wanna show he probally will be mad lol i dont really care hahahhaa im trying for number 1 in the nation
CJ "What's the best server/client for my machines?"
CJ "Oh and they're too far away to use a long VGA cable. And they're in separate rooms, I can't watch the other one"
Kay i keep pressing buttons sorry my bad
CJ So the guy suggests: "why don't you just install virtualbox on the ubuntu machine and use netflix from inside virtualbox?"
Kay thats GREATTT
Kay 
Kay im going for RN
CJ And now that I've said "for some reason virtualbox won't install. The module won't build, no matter what I do. It's an issue with my CPU, something something ,etc"
CJ Nobody will offer any other suggestions
Kay lol yea 
Kay im already a state tested nurses assistan
CJ They're all hypocrites
Kay assistant
CJ Linux is about choice
CJ But if you don't choose what linux users choose, you're well fucked
Kay yea i love nursing. so did u meet any girls down in bg??
CJ And I know they know the answers, because I'll end up getting frustrated, just using the option I didn't want to use, then after that start talking about it and then they'll be like "well why didn't you just use xXX?" which is an answer to my original problem
CJ And by then I've already reconfigured everything to work with the option I didn't want to use
Kay well wat happened
CJ So it's just like fuck it it's too late
Kay not the girl of your dreams huh?
Kay sont go looking for anyone
Kay dont
CJ So yeah
Kay i didnt go looking for anyone for a year and i found my man
CJ That's why I hate linux users :P
Kay he fell in love wit me
Kay hey that happens
Kay yea so far lol
Kay haha
CJ A tad
CJ Well really it would be more like </rant>
CJ /rant would execute the IRC command "rant" which doesn't exist :P
CJ :P
Kay like to work at
Kay i work at a nursing home ive worked there going on 2 years
Kay yea i love my residents where do u work
Kay :-)
Kay lol nice do u make good money doing that
Kay i know a couple people that work there
Kay oh well thats nive
Kay nice
Kay well thats a good job thats what i need
CJ ?
CJ :P
CJ :P
CJ ENEIGHTHUNDRED
CJ ENEIGHTHUNDREDENEIGHTHUNDRED
CJ EeePCs are overpriced
CJ Link to N10
CJ Oh wait that's $800 too isn't it?
CJ jesus
Kay yea
CJ bag of win: http://www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/cdetland.to?seg=HHO&poid=428720&fgpn=PSLB8U-0K704H
CJ That's even more overpriced than a eee
CJ It's a 9300
CJ It's not going to do a god damned thing
CJ On a scale from 1/100, in terms of video
CJ Intel integrated would sit at 10
CJ 9300 would sit at 15
CJ Either way, you aren't doing shit
CJ If all you can run is a simple desktop then who cares what the video card is
CJ Also: any plans on running linux, and the intel gets bonus points
CJ And the 9300 gets negative points
CJ nVidia DX10 cards blow ass in linux
CJ Intel integrated work fantastically in linux
CJ Then the eee isn't an option really
CJ If you want windows you gotta pay for the better one
CJ And even then it'll run like ass
CJ So you're willing to sacrifice linux to run windows on some overpriced piece of low-end hardware
CJ If that's the case then you have the decision to make, I can't tell you to buy one piece of shit over the other
CJ Because left up to me, I'd either save up for something nice, and not get either piece of shit, or find another option, and still not get either piece of shit
CJ But also, left up to me, I'd stick with my N800
CJ So I'm probably not a great person to ask
CJ My n800 can compile shit too
CJ WINE blows too
CJ You need windows, tbh
CJ If your school is that windows-centric, I wouldn't completely dump it
CJ I told you why I wouldn't pick either
CJ How so
CJ You know you don't have to say "thats neither here nor there" -_-
CJ Usability?
CJ Like, making sure people can use it?
CJ No wait that's accessibility
CJ I was going to say, wtfh, usability course and they force a certain product?
CJ I didn't say you didn't
CJ I told you what I thought
CJ You need to keep windows
CJ So get the best machine you think for windows
CJ It's a laptop, for notes, and you have a much higher end desktop, so I wouldn't even remotely factor in gaming
CJ Instead I'd first factor in cost, then usability, then lastly size
CJ Usability which includes the need to run windows
CJ A eee that runs a stripped down XP is the worst of the bad choices, imo
CJ So if you're stuck on eee or n10, then n10
CJ But only because you need windows
CJ It's not just that class
CJ You want something that'll last college
CJ Your school is windows-centric, so that's what you need to focus on
CJ A small ass keyboard sucks to type on, and to code on, I'll tell you that right now
CJ I've typed on a eee, and the n10 is _barely_ bigger, so I wouldn't imagine it'd be any better
CJ Some people are like "oh yeah it works great I can type so well!"
CJ But some people, like you and I, are not dwarfs
CJ So we can't easily use mini-keyboards
CJ You could use VNC or rdesktop, or even better if I find out how to run NX server in windows, that
CJ And run the mini-pc headless as your windows machine in your room
CJ NX is like VNC, only super compressed and very efficient, you can run it over the internet and it almost seems like the machine is in front of you
CJ extremely responsive
CJ Yeah, UI design is almost certainly going to force VS if you're a windows shop
Tifa Around.  Chillaxing with my sisters.  Leave me a message.
Tifa hey whats up?
Tifa oh, totally watched res evil degeneration the other night
Tifa i was disappointed in the romance
Tifa leon needs no woman.
Tifa lol
CJ Darn, it's being worked on
Tifa yessir
Tifa but i was yelling at the romance
CJ Once nomachine finishes an NX server for windows, game over dude
Tifa was not needed lol
CJ NX owns face
Tifa how has your break been?
Tifa interesting lol
Tifa yea
Tifa just got back from spending a week and a half at chris's
Tifa before that, was in a car accident
CJ Easily, share it via samba inside linux
CJ Bridge connection is best for vbox sharing
Tifa my sister, chris and i were out shopping day after christmas.  some lady was not paying attention and tried merging into our lane, pushing us onto the median.  she hit my sisters car, causing us to spin out into traffic and hit another car
Tifa then, she drove off.
Tifa my sisters car isnt too banged up, but is still in the shop
Tifa and we were all fine except for soreness a few days after
Tifa was scary as hell though, i was the side that got crunched
Tifa >_<
Tifa yeah.  little paranoid when in cars on the highway, but im alright ^_^
Tifa we were very lucky
Tifa how has your break been?
Tifa heh thats good ^_^
Tifa ive done a lot kinda
Tifa but ive also done a lot of laying around
Tifa yeah
Tifa havent played many video games though >_<
Tifa i saw some movies and read some though
Tifa heh
Tifa what movies?
Tifa lol
Tifa how was the ending of benjamin button?
Tifa i didnt get to see it because we had to leave the theatre
Tifa >_<
Tifa yeah
Tifa was 2 hours in
Tifa lmao
Tifa you would
Tifa lmao
CJ Or google docs
Tifa ?
Tifa have not heard of that one
Tifa yeesh
CJ Notecase works brilliantly
CJ I'm not a fan of onenote
CJ Honestly, though, Google docs works really well
Tifa jesus christ.
CJ And it's one central location that you don't need an IP for
CJ And can access anywhere
Tifa i missed it
Tifa >_<
CJ Well, Staples offers pen and paper
CJ They're much cheaper alternatives
CJ And if all you're doing is taking notes, it makes the most sense
CJ They have pens that save everything you write and email them to you
Tifa hooray
CJ That's digital
CJ No idea
CJ I think you're looking for a reason to spend money
CJ It's burning a hole in your pocket
CJ Invest it, now's about the time
Tifa i bought that movie 
Tifa :-D
CJ That doesn't change any of what I just said
CJ Think about it, you're going to spend hundreds of dollars on a device
CJ The only new functionality you gain is the ability to digitally take notes
CJ CDs
CJ Exactly why you buy now
CJ Because you're young, you don't need your money now, so you invest heavily, ride it out while everybody eats it, and eventually the old people are forced to sell and the economy rises again
CJ And you profit
CJ but that's beside the point
Tifa :3
Tifa bought a lot of dvds, or got them as gifts
Tifa i now have v for vendetta, the first 2 resident evil live actions, the prestige, labryinth, american psycho
CJ A CD is something you can stick money into today and nothing bad will happen for sure
CJ At any rate, these are just my thought processes
CJ Before any purchase
CJ Do the pros outweigh the cons, plain and simple
CJ Pro is: digital notes
CJ Con is: You're out a lotta money
CJ Honestly, if you really want to burn some cash, I'd go for a PS3 and a nice setup for it
CJ Extra controller, few games
CJ There are no libraries or computer labs?
CJ Random situations where it might be beneficial aren't really weighted as much -_-
CJ It's up to you
CJ If you're mostly after notes and stuff
CJ I'd grab me a tablet PC
CJ You can type when you have to, and you can draw when you need
CJ Which I found myself wanting a lot in science and math classes
CJ Isn't BGSU mostly technology?
CJ Oh
Tifa chris and i are considering getting a 360
CJ Anyway, yeah, tablet
CJ Which you can get for about as much as an n10
CJ The internet -_-
CJ Microcenter, newegg, etc.
CJ Hey, I'm not saying one way or the other
CJ I'm just telling you what I think about before a purchase
CJ No
CJ I was at micro center a few weeks ago
CJ They had a really nice one for 650
CJ Newegg, when they're in stock
CJ Cynical andy is no fun to talk to
CJ It's been in stuck several times
CJ stock*
CJ Who's pushy?
CJ I've specifically told you to do what you want
CJ And _offered_ my suggestions
CJ About what...?
CJ er...
CJ It is, it's called an opinion
CJ There are nicer and less accurate, according to my opinion, ways
CJ I decided on the word garbage because that, in my opinion, is a very accurate word to describe what you get for that amount of money
CJ If you don't want my opinions don't ask for them. I'm not going to alter them because you don't like the way they sound, sorry
CJ Wait, huh?
CJ Right, I was asking the answer to a question
CJ You were asking my opinion
CJ My opinion was that neither were a good choice
CJ My opinion was that I didn't want to choose between them
CJ And then after establishing that, I went on to offer more of my opinion in the related field
CJ Do you have Windows 20003 installed anywhere?
CJ 2003*
CJ :(
CJ Hrm...
CJ By chance do you have a "tscc.msc" on any of them?
CJ Preferably XP
CJ Yeah
CJ Can you zip up tscc.msc and tscc.dll and send them to me if you do?
CJ :(
CJ Stupid terminal services
CJ Fuck it, SP3 it is
CJ noober XP
CJ So, with my raise3
CJ raise*
CJ I can start my 401k at 7% of my income
CJ And not see any change in my paycheck
CJ Yeah
CJ Which is a decent amount of money
CJ About 80 bucks every 2 weeks
CJ Going into a portfolio
CJ And after another year or so, they'll start matching it
CJ I think it'll be about 50 cents on the dollar
CJ On top of interest, and since I'm young I'll aggressively invest
CJ Interest aside, that's about 2200 bucks a year, tax-free
CJ Not to mention the matching
CJ And that's with my small current salary :D
CJ blech
CJ note to all: pizza rolls sitting in a freezer without power for 2 days become gross when thawed and refrozen
CJ I didn't refreeze it, it was in the freezer and he fixed the outlet today
CJ So it refroze
CJ I was just hungry as fuck and figured pizza rolls were probably the only safe choice out of my fridge
CJ I was wrong :(
CJ Hopefully my pepto and delicious condiments are alright
CJ lets try the chicken now
CJ Decent
CJ You'll hate teh keyboard
CJ You have bigger hands than me iirc
CJ ?
CJ Larger battery?
CJ Yeah

CJ Which is a big difference
CJ 20 bucks for longer battery
CJ Easy choice

CJ I used a 930 I think
CJ GOD FUCKING DAMN IT MICROSOFT

CJ NFS allows for a buttfuckload of storage
CJ A BUTFUCKLOAD
CJ BUTT*
CJ Network File Share
CJ A BUTTFUCKLOAD ANDY
CJ I think I should write microsoft a letter
CJ Informing them that they FUCKING SUCK FUCKING DICK THE FAGGOTY FAGGOTY PIECES OF FUCKING SHIT

CJ from the repository
CJ Not software repos, the bzr repo

CJ 22:54 < DBO> dmsuperman, bzr branch lp:do
Sis kk
CJ Yeah
CJ But that's what he told me to do
Sis it was kinda stupid

CJ Ah yeah you need a launchpad account
CJ Well make a dir for it
CJ cd into that dir
CJ Like you did for compiz
CJ And then do it again
CJ After grabbing a launchpad account
CJ Yeah
CJ It can be done in Intrepid
CJ Mono is the open source .NET implementation
CJ deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/firerabbit/ubuntu hardy main
CJ deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/firerabbit/ubuntu hardy main
CJ Replace "hardy" with "intrepid"
CJ sudo apt-get update
CJ Then install mono 2.0
CJ I'm not sure the package name
CJ But know that mono-2.0 isn't it iirc :P
CJ There are 2 main versions of mono
CJ 1.0 and 2.0
CJ For supporting .NET 1.0 and 2.0
CJ But iirc mono-2.0 is version 2 of support for .net 1.0
CJ That's all I know about it
CJ So I'm probably not the best person to ask any more questions about it :P
CJ What error
CJ Watch Death Race
CJ Terrible :(
CJ Jason Statham what are you doing :(
CJ Hmm...you sure you installed mono 2.0?
CJ It was so bad
CJ It was like an action movie but without any of the exciting action parts
CJ Watching Eagle Eye now
CJ Gonna have a LAN party over here tomorrow :D

CJ Sweet
Sis going to kevin's ttyl
Sis I am away from my computer right now.
CJ Installable, sure
CJ rsync makes a recoverable backup
CJ rsync -aPv --delete --exclude=/lost+found --exclude=/tmp --exclude=/media --exclude=/home --exclude=/sys --exclude=/proc --exclude=/dev --exclude=/mnt --exclude=/storage --exclude=/backups --exclude=/av / /media/backups-folder
CJ Ubuntu needs no special flags to be bootable
CJ Just point grub at it
CJ And how else would you make a backup of something?
CJ "grub"
Kim oh well
CJ Yeah, execute it
CJ that's how you reinstall grub
CJ You could always dd the drive
CJ That'd be the absolute easiest
CJ There would be no room for doing it wrong
CJ dd is a direct, bit for bit, copy of a drive or partition
CJ You'd do the drive
CJ To include the partition table
CJ And MBR
CJ But anyway, that command above
CJ That's what I use to back up my drive
CJ It would then make a backup of "/" to "/media/backups-folder"
CJ Excluding all the special dirs that I don't need it to back up
CJ Then in the future I would just rsync it from the backup to the new partition and recreate the directories I excluded (so it can mount to the mountpoints)
CJ Ah, you wouldn't need --delete
CJ That's actually for the incremental backups
CJ The script I wrote looks in my backups directory
CJ It finds the latest one, and hardlinks the entire thing into a new directory
CJ Essentially creating an exact copy without taking up any space
CJ Since hardlinks point to the existing data
CJ Follow?
CJ So, it has a direct copy
CJ Then I run that command, only instead of /media/backups-folder it points at my new copy, obviously
CJ What it does is go through my entire /, excluding all those dirs, and for every file or folder, checks the destination
Kim goodnight
CJ If the destination doesn't exist, it creates it. If it's the same, it does nothing (keeping the hardlink and taking up no space for that file). If it's different, it copies it to the destination overtop of the hardlink
CJ So for original: file1, file2, file3, and destination, file1, file2, both file1's are the same, file2's differ
CJ rsync would create file3, leave file1 alone (meaning it takes up no more space because it's a hardlink) and overwrites file2's link with an actual file
CJ --delete means if it's no longer in the original but in the destination then delete it from the destination
CJ This means that I end up with fully incremental backups, where each backup only takes up as much space as all the modified files, each independent
CJ I could restore, copy, or delete any one of them and nothing would happen to the others
CJ Right now, my / is about 7GB
CJ I have 10 backups of it, totalling 15GB
CJ And they're not compressed in any way
CJ This is exactly how subversion works internally
CJ For every revision it hardlinks the entire old one into the new one and overwrites modified files
CJ Really close together :P
CJ 320: 40GB /, 70GB windows, 20GB for test installation, 20GB for another test, 4GB for swap, remaining for /home
CJ And everything else is formatted to just have a single ext3 spanning the whole drive
CJ One of them is /backups, one of them is /av, one is /storage
CJ One isn't mounted as anything right now
CJ GRUB has like 13 entries
CJ One of them is windows
CJ I use chainloader +1 and just boot to the XP ntldr
CJ Ext2IFS
CJ Lets you read/write Ext2/3 drives
CJ I disable writing
CJ Because I don't want windows infecting my babies
CJ :P
CJ Alright, turn 21, then give me your age
CJ So I can go buy myself some jager right now
CJ Fuck you
CJ I'm not even 20 yet
CJ I don't really mind it, if I truly cared there's people I can go to
CJ I can get 35% off most lenovo laptops :O
CJ Fucking hate 9PM bullshit
CJ So fail
CJ Who the fuck goes to get jager before 9PM
CJ Luckily I can get it all the time
CJ I was actually looking at it
CJ I'm not sure about linux though
CJ And nobody in -offtopic seemss to know
CJ I would just run Ubuntu
CJ It's an Atom with 1GB RAM
CJ It comes with XP Home
CJ I'd use normal Ubuntu :P
CJ $383, and I _think_ I get 30% off that
CJ Lemme see
CJ I've decided that's what I need
CJ Is a laptop
CJ More than a bigger iPod, because mine works
CJ I don't need another 22" monitor
CJ I don't play games often enough to justify a PS3, and my current setup works as a far superior media center anyway
CJ I'm not moving my 5.1 to my PS3, and it wouldn't even support it anyway
CJ So PS3 in that crappy TV with crappy TV speakers
CJ Defeats the media center, I don't play enough games
CJ I need a laptop since mine broke
CJ I can take notes on my n800 but typing on that keyboard sucks
CJ During meetings it's my only choice, and it'll work great
CJ $384 is already top of the line in terms of price I'd pay for such things
CJ I don't like that it's so small
CJ But at least, from what I'm reading/hearing, it runs linux pretty well
CJ And it's not completely overpriced
CJ :O whare?
CJ Ooooh I get 25% off toshiba
CJ Random crazy HP linux
CJ Sounds scary
CJ And tiny hard drive
CJ S10 has 160GB :P
CJ :O*
CJ FAILWTF
CJ And it has microsoft works?
CJ wtf?!
CJ Not according to HP.com
CJ http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/computer_can_series.do?storeName=computer_store&category=notebooks&a1=Category&v1=Mini&series_name=minimi_series
CJ Bottom there
CJ Issue is, 1.6GHz
CJ OO.o is a fucking beast of a hog
Kay u made it home alive
CJ 1.6GHz isn't a lot to work with for such a large and blaoted app
CJ It doesn't run the greatest on _my_ machine
CJ :P
CJ Which has been changed recentely
CJ And no longer works right in my N800
CJ This saddens me :(
CJ Toshiba has no good deals :(
CJ Gah, this is failure
CJ FAILURE
CJ I think the S10 is what I'm looking at for now
CJ I'll have to research more
CJ K, Netbook Remix is apparently the way to go for the S10
CJ Yeah, $384
Kay lol
Kay no 
Kay was that friday nite i ws bored 
Kay if so i went to the bfs house
Kay yea sure 
Kay im just so done wit everything
Kay my mom is so fucknig annoying i cant take it

Kay i cant go away to college i have a horse
Kay yep
Sis bed time
Sis hey
CJ2 I think, by far, the one thing that sucks about Risk
CJ2 Is that if you're playing unskilled people, you can only play once
CJ2 After a single game they realize that you're a good risk player
CJ2 And every other game they just gang up on you
CJ2 And that a _lot_ comes down to chance
CJ2 I literally just owned 3/4 the world
CJ2 And another player took it over with 20 people
CJ2 He just kept rolling 6's over and over and over and I just kept rolling 1's and 3's
CJ2 He took out all my reinforcements
CJ2 Split my ownership of Asia, North America, and removed my wedge in his Africa
CJ2 Which drops 12 of my reinforcements off
CJ2 Plus one for each territory
Kim hi
CJ2 Still makes me lol

CJ So did I
CJ You did it wrong
CJ I'm the professional grepper her
CJ here*
CJ Well there's no way I could have modified that
CJ grep is a regular expression math
CJ match*
CJ grep '?'
CJ Not grep ?
CJ Then make sure you have  | sed 's/??/???/'
CJ Otherwise your logs will be broken
CJ No it fixes your logs
CJ IT FUCKING FIXES THEM ANDY

CJ I'm not sure what to do with my still unpartitioned 400GB drive
CJ Programs?
CJ wtf?
CJ Install to /opt
CJ Oh, install to Program Files
CJ Corrected what
CJ You didn't...
CJ Not before I kicked you in the face you didn't
CJ failure.
CJ 23:20 <andrew> ??
CJ 23:21  * dmsuperman kicks you in the fucking face
CJ 23:21 <andrew> program files?
CJ nuh.
CJ Which is first
CJ Mine
CJ Or yours
CJ Mine is
CJ I win.
CJ No they aren't
CJ They're recorded in order
CJ And my computer is faster
CJ FASTER ANDY
CJ You remember, back when you used to use windows
CJ You installed programs to Program Files
CJ Then had no way of updating them
CJ Or sharing data between them
CJ And configuration was done by some dumb fucking registry
CJ Install apps to /opt in linux, Program Files in windows
CJ So my signature in /. is a forkbomb
CJ Ohhhh, I see
CJ projects
CJ /storage/projects
CJ 500GB
CJ It's decent
CJ For hellboy it's good
CJ But hellboy isn't very good
CJ Take ages to fill it up with just that
CJ Yeah that's what my 1TB is
CJ 45% full
CJ Like 200GB movies
CJ 12GB pictures
CJ Putting all those on one drive aren't a good idea
CJ Too many partitions run too slowly
CJ Small drive for main stuff, I used my existing 320GB for OSes, /home, swap
CJ Any and all storage are large drives
CJ I don't use external because they're slow as balls
CJ They won't
CJ Why would they be?
CJ The hardlinks point to the backup data, not the original data
CJ That's the point of a backup :P
CJ :P
CJ The first time you make a backup it'll be a 100% copy
CJ Then after that you'll hardlink and build your increments :P
CJ 8...what
CJ 8 girth units!
CJ warcraft?
CJ wtf?
CJ Brian Reagan standup
CJ Does warcraft run as its own OS?
CJ Why a partition for a game?
CJ I don't get the point of it being on another partition
CJ What is it?
CJ The installer?
CJ So...then what's on it if you have no OS?
CJ Is it the installer?
CJ :S
CJ You realize that windows doesn't work like that right
CJ Warcraft?
CJ Warcraft III?
CJ Or 2?
CJ Oh
CJ Yeah I know linux works like that
CJ I'm just saying putting the program files data on another partition serves no purpose
CJ Since you have to reinstall anyway
CJ ...why would you mount hte game files partition
CJ I'm just confused as to why you made another partition
CJ Er...if you say so
CJ You should fix it by formatting the whole drive
CJ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda
CJ GO
CJ You can do it now
CJ Just unmount it
Kim k
CJ2 Get me an i7 940 with watercooling
CJ2 For my birthday
CJ2 Or I'll kill you

CJ Oh
CJ I dunno
CJ Yes, a mountpoint
CJ The point where you mount drives
CJ See if it doesn't like leaving your home directory
CJ MAke it ~/.irclogs/im/$0.log
CJ And see if that works
CJ penisy
CJ You did in what you showed me :P
CJ Failure :P

CJ On Friday
CJ On my credit card
CJ And get 8% back :O
CJ My friend brought in his aspire one
CJ So fucking fail
CJ Download the PDT from the website
CJ Extract into /opt/eclipse
CJ Then go grab the SubClipse plugin url and use the Eclipse plugins thing (under help -> updates)
CJ And pop it in and install SubClipse
CJ Yes, PDT
CJ From there you can choose to use integrated FTP client
CJ I personally use FileZilla
CJ For FTP
CJ Er, to connect
CJ Clients usually aren't good servers -_-
CJ Er...all of them -_-
CJ ...whichever servers you want
CJ ...and whichever purposes you want
CJ -_-
CJ Created a PHP project
CJ Er, you sure you got PDT
CJ And new PHP project exists no where
CJ If it's java you went somewhere wrong and didn't get PDT
CJ It's IRregardless
CJ Duh
CJ Welcome to sarcasm
CJ You must be new here

CJ2 That risk game
CJ2 I ended up coming back and kicking all three of their asses
CJ2 Took the last two out in one turn
CJ2 Hell yeah
CJ2 I ended up pulling just the right card
CJ2 I had 2 sets of 3 and traded them both in
CJ2 Got 55 from that
CJ2 Short game?
CJ2 40's of turnins?
CJ2 55 > 40
CJ2 Oooooh you mean it's up to 40
CJ2 Nevermind
CJ2 No yeah 55 combined
CJ2 Yeah 25 and 30
CJ2 It wasn't short
CJ2 Nobody remembered to even collect cards for the first half
CJ2 Then I remembered and started collecting

CJ That's not what docky does
CJ :P
CJ I don't get the point
CJ Right, why are some left and some right
CJ Er, ok
CJ Every day would be marked for me then
CJ I only occasionally have eventless days
CJ Wouldn't be terrible
CJ Just write a script in the language of your choice (bash to be quickest and most portable) to output the strings to build it
CJ Just like to point out that forwarding X over SSH owns face
CJ VNC runs like bawls over LAN even, but forwarding X you can't even tell the difference
CJ Like at all
CJ Aye
CJ Do you have two linux machines?
CJ No two physical machines
CJ Both there?
CJ Run SSH server on one
CJ Then from the other type "ssh -XC ip-of-host firefox"
CJ That'll run firefox on the host machine but forward all the X traffic to your local machine
CJ Like citrix did in Auburn only this doesn't blow ass
CJ Since it forwards the X traffic intead of the direct video, A: it's faster, and B: it asks your local computer to decorate it instead of decorating it remotely so it matches
CJ And yeah, pretty much
CJ Only issue would be saving to local from that firefox
CJ You'd have to use like NFS and mount local to host and save from host to local
CJ Kind of abstract way
CJ Though I almost never save from firefox directly, I just copy links and wget them in a terminal
CJ Why use wget?
CJ Yeah
CJ Since it's running on the host
CJ It has access to host file system, not local
CJ Holy FUCK that scared me
CJ I'm tired as shit and I forgot I set an alarm to play All That Remains - The Weak Willed at 2am
CJ I just fell asleep as I was talking to you and it went off loud as fuck
Wise-A what was that AVI converter?

CJ what up dawg.
CJ svnadmin
CJ Sorry I assumed you already had an SVN server up and running, do you?
CJ http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=51753
CJ It's for Apache + SVN (you can either serve up repos through http/apache or svn/subversion) + SSL, but it tells you which steps to skip if you don't need SSL
CJ Then svnadmin to create actual repositories
CJ I dunno I sent you the guide
CJ I dunno I sent you teh guide
CJ Whatever you set the alias as, use that
CJ I set my alias as svn
CJ And set up a repository called web-mp3
CJ So to access it, I use http://dmsuperman.com/svn/web-mp3
CJ Gotta use an svn client
CJ If you're just using the cli client it's like "svn co http://localhost/svn/repo/folder" or something
CJ That's to checkout, no idea for anything else
Kim hi

Kim Joan is my neighbore by the way
Kim k, well i had asked Joan 2 days before to take me to the hospital to get my MRI and drop it off and becuase she said yes to that my mom asked if she could tag along to see the house, so Joan said yes. well while we were at the house mom and i had to fill out some forms, and we were getting to the end of it and Joan had come in to use the washroom, and she had a joking tone on and she suggested 
Kim that i take liam for a 2 min walk. well she didn't ask me cause she didn't look at me and yeh, well the way she put it i giggled and we were goina be leaving soon anyways, so there was no point, well she thinks i made a face at her probably beucase i was wearing heels and standing around so my feet were hurting.well when we got into the car she turned to my mom and said (joking tone again) when..
Kim you want a ride somewhere i'm not goina take you, you can find your own way. well Joans British so you have to know when they joke and when they don't. well mom and i both thought she was joking, so my mom called everywhere else to get a ride to my dr apt. and no one can take her so she called Joan. Well Joan started bitching and saying no beucase of me not taking Liam for a walk when my feet were
Kim hurting(she didnt know they were hurting) so now mom and i are trying to find another way there, and it's not workin so well
Kim GAH!

Sis yeah cdo 
Sis all done
CJ2 Your mom
CJ2 I'm too lazy to go back home to get my trackball mouse, do it for me
CJ2 Haha
CJ2 No, back to my apartment
CJ2 I'm at school
CJ2 Yeah so I have MPD working remotely
CJ2 It's superpimp
CJ2 Uhm...what's that have to do with anything?
CJ2 Blech
CJ2 amaroK is meh, not to mention loading up all those KDE libs and using a Qt interface makes it lose points
CJ2 The reason I like remote MPD is that I can sort my library and such but I don't need to scan it via SSHFS
CJ2 The library lives at home
Sis my show's over too
CJ2 Are you more intrigued by "easy to setup" or "geek factor"?
Sis good
CJ2 It's not as simple to do as just doing SSHFS, but in the long run it works better, for me at least, not to mention with this setup I have on-the-fly transcoding to lower bandwidth requirements
CJ2 Hahaha
CJ2 Blach
CJ2 Anyway
CJ2 First, MPD, install, setup, etc.
CJ2 Then, install and configure icecast (package name is icecast2-server I think) (configuring means just change the password it defaults to)
CJ2 Then edit /etc/mpd.conf to have a second output entry so it outputs to the icecast server
CJ2 You can specify the bitrate it'll output here, I chose 160 to keep nice quality but to still lower bandwidth for 320
CJ2 Oddly, and this may differ for you, but I spent an hour trying to figure out what was wrong with my setup when I was testing
CJ2 But when I connected to my own local icecast server from my desktop to my desktop there was odd skips/lag/something
CJ2 Just as a forewarning, if you want to test it and you're getting that issue try from your other computer before ripping hair out
CJ2 My friend did the same setup as I at the same time and didn't have the issue, so you may not even run into it (also it mostly had to do with using VLC as the player, I think mplayer did it fine)
CJ2 This is all you do on your desktop, then the only other thing you do on your laptop or whatever is use SSH to forward the ports and mplayer to playback, then connect to localhost with your MPD client of your choosing
CJ2 You need to forward 8000 (the stream itself) and 6600 (to actually connect to MPD to control the music)
CJ2 To do this, "ssh -Llocalhost:8000:remote_machine:8000 remote_user@remote_machine"
CJ2 I find setting up an authorized_keys file to avoid putting in your password makes things easiest
CJ2 Do that twice, once for 8000 and once for 6600
CJ2 And then open up your client of choice and connect to localhost:6600 to control it
CJ2 And lastly, playback via "mplayer http://localhost:8000/mpd.ogg"
CJ2 All-in-all, once it's all said and done, it typically only takes me about 15 seconds to load it all up and connect from my laptop to actually use it
CJ2 I scripted the port forwards
CJ2 The _only_ thing, and I _know_ there's a fix for it but I can't for the live of me find it, is that using most players (vlc and mplayer included) when you pause playback, MPD stops sending data to the icecast stream and the sream ends, effectively ending the playback until you replay it
CJ2 If I paused more often I would look harder for the fix (it makes MPD send silence during pause and such to keep the stream open)
CJ2 But if you need to pause, you just have to restart the mplayer after unpausing the stream
Sis 3 of 5 boxes done in a new sudoku
Sis yeah only 5
Sis lol
CJ2 http://ircwall.snuxoll.com/quotes/46
CJ2 Fucking lol
Sis it's the 5 intersecting one
Sis i dont' know about there being a 9 intersecing puzzle
Sis 4 boxes done
Sis i havne't done any homework btw, 
Sis just thought i would add that
Sis you should check your facebook flair
Sis just sayin
Sis thought i'd catch uyp
Sis up
Sis 1 box left
Sis and it's hard
Sis all done
Sis all done with the sudoku
Sis now it's dial time
Sis brb
Sis just finished 5 intersecting sudokus, time for a break and food
Kim hi
Sis kk
CJ Yeah
CJ Magazine
CJ Oh this isn't a word association game
CJ pimp
CJ Uhm, header takes a single arg
CJ Unless I'm mistaken
CJ The "I" looking things are borked tabs
CJ It's fine
CJ Use strstr to match it instead of substr
CJ As long as the URL contains register.php and you match instead of check equality then it would redirect
CJ htaccess
CJ Yeah, do it with .htaccess and mod_rewrite
CJ RewriteEngine on
CJ RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
CJ RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
CJ # Anything that doesn't start with app/, forward to public/
CJ RewriteRule ^(?!(app/|public/))(.+?)$ public/$2
CJ That's what I have for mine
CJ Make your regex actually just "^(.+?)$"
CJ And public/$2 to subvn/BGUNDEAD/$1
CJ Should be good
CJ Put it in .htaccess in the root of your dir
CJ Those first three are lines of code
CJ Copy them
CJ Put it in your htdocs root
CJ Inside it put http://paste.dmsuperman.com/86
CJ Also make sure mod_rewrite is enabled
CJ I think "sudo a2enmod rewrite" will do it automagically
CJ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart after that to reload
CJ Oh and /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default inside <directory /var/www> (or wherever you htdocs is) there's a line that says AllowOverride make sure it's AllowOVerride all
CJ No idea in vim
CJ touch /path/to/file to creat it with bash
CJ brb
CJ k
CJ Humping doesn't typically work
CJ ffffffffffffjfjfjfffffhhfhfhfhhhhhhfhfhfhfhfffffhfhfhfhfhfhfjgjgjfjfhfhfjfjfjfjffhfhfh
CJ And you did all the other steps?
CJ Edited 000-default and a2endmod
CJ And you edited 000-default
CJ There are _2_ <directory> tags, you need to edit the one with /var/www
CJ You did that?
CJ That allows you to use .htaccess files basically
CJ Otherwise it ignores them
CJ I cn haz SSH?
CJ Hmmmm
CJ Reverse SSH ftw, fuck your school firewall
CJ Anyway pastebin /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default and /var/www/.htaccess
CJ Also /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/rewrite.load
CJ sudo apt-get install pastebinit rox btw
CJ cat /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/rewrite.load | pastebinit
Kim hi
CJ http://dmsuperman.pastebin.com/f55d04fa3
CJ irssi fucking rox
CJ "/exec -o cat /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/rewrite.load | pastebinit"
CJ Just typed that and it ran it
CJ Odd, just pastebin.com then I guess -_-
CJ And restarting apache does nothing?
CJ Odd
CJ You have some _serious_ lag again :P
TyCool not sure, i was at school, its probably the internet connection, ill have to check about it
CJ Here
CJ Sorry
CJ I was away
CJ HAha
CJ Oh
CJ Hmmm
CJ I'm not really sure what's going on without further investigation :(
CJ Haha
CJ Yes and no
CJ VirtualHosts
CJ No idea if it works with PC name
CJ But it works for domains
CJ I set a virtual host for paste.dmsuperman.com and with that I change the DocumentRoot to /storage/www/pastebin
CJ Cool
CJ 000-default
CJ By default it has the catch-all *
CJ Add another
CJ :D
CJ Adds what twice...?
CJ You changed your docroot ;)
CJ Put it back :P
CJ Hmmm
CJ You don't have .htaccess in BGUNDEAD do you?
CJ Yeah double check that
CJ  / /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default
CJ Ooooh you're using it for SVN
CJ Just do a soft redirect
CJ Like a header redirect, not invisible
CJ I have no idea what you're doing
CJ Why are you redirecting / to your SVN repo anyway?
CJ I think I know what you want before you finish explaining
CJ You want to access your website directly out of the repo
CJ The latest version alway
CJ always*
CJ Wherever you check it out to, symlink that into your /var/www folder
CJ So if you keep your projects in /media/storage/projects, symlink /media/storage/projects/BGUNDEAD to /var/www/BGUNDEAD
CJ ...how do you edit it?
CJ svn co http://localhost/subvn/BGUNDEAD
CJ Make sure your repo has permissions in the svn auth file
CJ Remove your .htaccess you don't need that
CJ And make sure docroot is back to /var/www
CJ Whichever it was originally
CJ I think documentroot has no trailing slash
CJ And then <Directory /var/www/>
CJ First and foremost you need SVN working
CJ Does it have anything in it?
CJ Have you added anything to it?
CJ Have you ever successfully used it at all?
CJ But have yo uused it
CJ Alright
CJ Just to simplify things
CJ Delete the repo
CJ Then make sure you have an SVN user setup
CJ You do hae an SVN user right?
CJ Well sadly I don't remember the syntax for it, but you can look in the svnadmin manpage for how to create a user I think
CJ Or rather it uses htpasswd
CJ Look in /etc/apache2/dav_svn.passwd
CJ See if you have a user
CJ Sure
CJ cat,gedit,nano
CJ Alright so you have a user, you remember the password to it?
CJ Alright, then create a repo
CJ svnadmin create /path/to/repo/dir/repo_name
CJ Shit
CJ delete that, re-run with sudo
CJ I've had issues :S
CJ sudo rm -rf but yeah
CJ Dude fucking All That Remains - The Fall of Ideals is such a bad ass album
CJ Anyway
CJ Recreate with sudo
CJ Then sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/repo/repo_name
CJ That makes sure Apache can write to it
CJ Now you have a repo, time to add your SVN user to it
CJ http://paste.dmsuperman.com/87
CJ That's my /etc/apache2/dav_svn.authz
CJ Adapt to replace dmsuperman with svnuser
CJ Then you should be able to cd to your projects dir and "svn co http://localhost/subvn/repo_name"
CJ Oh make sure your dav_svn.authz uses the proper repo name too
CJ Line 8 is where I define the repo name
Sis pollyeyes
Sis hey
CJ Just repo_name
CJ _change_ library
CJ bgundead:/
CJ 21:00 <dmsuperman> Then you should be able to cd to your projects dir and "svn co http://localhost/subvn/repo_name"
CJ No that's for testing, we're just working on SVN for now
CJ You used bgundead everywhere right
CJ Not BGUNDEAD
CJ Try going to the repo in your browser
CJ See what you get
CJ aye
CJ h/o
CJ pastebin /etc/apache2/conf.d/svn.conf
CJ Er, what?
CJ Where's your SVN configuration at then?
CJ cd /etc/apache2/
CJ cd into that dir
CJ grep -ir "svn" .
CJ Then pastebin the file that contains the line Dav svn
CJ You cd'ed into /etc/apache2 first right
CJ Like I said
CJ Otherwise it's searching your cwd
CJ :P
CJ Runs instantaneously for me
CJ ctrl-c and rerun with sudo
CJ Perhaps it's caught on a file it can't read
CJ wtfh
CJ du -chs
CJ In that dir
CJ what in the hell
CJ Try looking around manually then
CJ Should see something like a <Location "/svn">
CJ OR /subvn
CJ /etc/apache2
CJ Probably in every file in conf.d
CJ and in the 000-default
CJ And...httpd something
CJ pastebin it
CJ The file
CJ Ok you don't have it set up for /subvn in any way :P
CJ Change your svn co to use /svn not /subvn
CJ http://localhost/svn/bgundead
CJ Nevermind
CJ You didn't use the guide I sent you
CJ Lemme pastebin mine
CJ Nuh, you have an entirely different cfg 
CJ Nevermind
CJ I'm dumb
CJ Gimme a moment
CJ http://dmsuperman.pastebin.com/faa70a88
CJ dav_svn.conf in mods-enabled
CJ http://dmsuperman.pastebin.com/f2a297547
CJ /etc/apache2/conf.d/svn.conf
CJ Aye
CJ Then try it
CJ Oh make sure you edited those to use your own physical paths of course
CJ Mine's /storage/svn I think
CJ ^
CJ And restarted
CJ And www-data has read/write to /media/storage/svn/bgundead
CJ What about the files inside
CJ fuggit sudo chmod 0777 ./* inside it
CJ No go? What d you mean?
CJ gah wtf
CJ Which URL are you going to?
CJ I honestly have no idea wtf else is going on
CJ Try svn co again
CJ See if it asks for user
CJ If not, Forbidden typically means permissions error
CJ sudo chmod -R 0777 ./* inside the repo dir
CJ HAha, nice
CJ Alrighty
CJ Gah wrong window
CJ Haha, sure thing
CJ That's easy :P
CJ See ya
Caitlyn Hi but can't talk bed time
Caitlyn Night
Sis yeah,

Sis but being sick didn't help
Sis my throat's on fire

Sis ok, 
Sis i got spanish hw, done, acct done, some econ done

Kim hi
Kim how are yuoui
Kim you*
Kim i'm ok
Kim ok
Kim ttyl bye
Sis bye
Wise you check FEAR 2demo yet?
CJ2 Fuck dude
CJ2 Lamb of God - Descending
CJ2 _SO_ fucking badass
CJ2 Your mom
CJ2 It's 6am
CJ2 I've been up all night reconfiguring my VPS
CJ2 But now it's super-slim
CJ2 Uses 80-110MB RAM
CJ2 And also my reattach script reattachs remotely for irssi windows
CJ No.
CJ This is an automated message to tell you to fuck off
CJ Yeah well I programmed it to be realistic
CJ Just grabbed it
CJ My irssi is being hosted in it now
CJ No this is mine
CJ ...what?
CJ No a VPS is a remotely managed hardware server in which you remotely install and OS and manage it yourself
CJ They give me a VM hosted on an uber huge server, I get 360MB RAM, some hard drive space, and a CPU quota
CJ I installed Ubuntu and irssi, screen, apache, mysql, php, iptables
CJ ~$20/mo
CJ linode.com
CJ Fucking fantastic service so far
CJ You get to pick which data center it's hosted in, almost all your changes are instant
CJ They pro-rate everything
CJ I know a guy who was telling me he literally only needed something to test for a day, he paid $20 for it, used it, cancelled it, and they refunded $19
CJ They have pre-fab OS images for most linux distros, customized to run very slim. I installed 8.10, total install size is 250MB
CJ You can upload a custom img if you want
CJ I get like fucking 5mb/s from the newark datacenter so I hosted mine there
CJ Hmmm, I dunno actually
CJ Most likely server
CJ I slimmed it down a little bit further, added firewall, uses 80-120MB RAM
CJ Yeah
CJ The only unstable apps run in X
CJ It's just iptables firewall
CJ Fucking win firewall
CJ Uses like < 1MB RAM
CJ And it has a custom filter set
CJ So I just say
CJ Reject everything that isn't SSH or HTTP
CJ And I moved SSH off the default port
CJ SSH has the magic ability to forward ports, so if I need anything else I'll run it through an SSH server
CJ SSH tunnel*
CJ Fuck dude Lamb of God is so badass
CJ I wanna go see them live sometime
CJ Tittered?
CJ Eh, good for him
CJ I think they're badass
CJ I don't really like most metal anymore, every single band just does that inhale screaming for an hour and it's annoying
CJ LoG has those really badass breakdowns and the vocals are screaming without being annoying
CJ Well that was an exaggeration
CJ I like All That Remains too, but I'm sure he hates them
CJ Most metalheads hate them :P
CJ Because they're hardcore and metal :S
CJ You like them?
CJ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm2sgkePk_I
CJ Like that
CJ That song is badass
CJ Yeah
CJ My desktop can't
CJ I have unstable power
CJ Also shitty upload
CJ And when I take my computer to a LAN party my website comes down :P
CJ Traffic?
CJ On your network you mean?
CJ Ooooh
CJ I see
CJ linode doesn't allow anything illegal anyway :P
CJ VPS win
CJ What
CJ What's fer dinner
CJ HEY NIGGER FACE
CJ DIN DIN
CJ Tell me

CJ svnadmin create /path/to/repo
Kim hi
Kim nm you
Kim i got accsepted into niagara College
Kim thanks
CJ Depends, if you're the only one using it then it doesn't matter
CJ I typically set them up like this:
Kim im' trying to approve for it, but the stupid site wont work
CJ Top left: trunk, branches
CJ Under trunk: www, doc, db
CJ Under branches: versions, users
CJ Under versions is where I'd create a branch for a rlease version, and under users is where each user could branch it for himself and work on a separate copy
CJ I'm about to begin a break in class though, gotta go print something, so I'll bbiaf
Sis i'm coloring now
Sis care bears
Sis lol
Kim march 18th
Sis noppers

CJ ?
CJ What didn't it do -_-
CJ Can't fucking create a gantt chart worth a damn, and when I finally hacked one together it couldn't scale it to print to a page
CJ Can't copy charts to other worksheets, so I have to make sure my chart covers up the text that powers it
CJ My proposal paper about how I'm going to write my research paper -_-
CJ I kicked my whole fucking group out of my group though haha
CJ Yeah we set up rules to begin with
CJ They all suck so I called them on breaking the rules
CJ ie due dates
CJ Mostly, except now I gotta write this whole fucking paper myself
CJ But at least I'll get a good grade on it
Kim why?
Sis lol
Sis going ocd on my crayons
Kim ok
CJ No idea the commands
CJ I use Subclipse plugin for eclipse to manage
CJ But most likely, yeah

CJ2 Fuck
CJ2 Yo
CJ2 Couch
CJ2 Nigga
CJ2 loligators
CJ2 I have a laptop, MCE remote, N800 to do that :D
CJ2 :P
CJ2 I'm learning LaTeX
CJ2 Is gud
CJ2 It's basically a way to write your documents in such a way that it doesn't depend on the editor
CJ2 Lemme pastebin
CJ2 http://paste.cjohnson.me/102
CJ2 That's what I've got so far
CJ2 A majority of that will never change and is supplied by the new document template
CJ2 Mostly metadata and such
CJ2 http://cjohnson.me/test2.pd
CJ2 http://cjohnson.me/test2.pdf
CJ2 That's what it outputs (Ctrl + Alt + 1 to output)
CJ2 So I don't have to deal with the bullshit of OO.o, I can use my editor of choice (gedit), or perhaps do it in nano remotely
CJ2 Then just save as PDF
CJ2 Not really, like I said most of that is the metadata that you don't work with
CJ2 Once you're actually writing you mostly just get text
CJ2 You just write you text
CJ2 I'm just working on document format
CJ2 Which is the real cool thing
CJ2 It's kind of like CSS for documents
CJ2 This right now is just my stylesheet, but once I write things it'll format as I've specified
CJ2 I shall give you my finished paper when I finish it :)

CJ2 Yeah
CJ2 1 Paper is 12 pages, another is 5
CJ2 Lotsa fucking fun :P
CJ2 So yeah
CJ2 Fucking owned those dudes
CJ2 No idea what they were doing
CJ2 3 rounds in I had a line of defences down the middle of africa and europe, 10 in each territory, with 20 over in kamchatka
CJ2 I figured they were amassing and preparing to break in
CJ2 Went over cautiously to find out the biggest army anybody had was 4 or 5 sitting in one territory
CJ2 God damn it
CJ2 I wish I had something to smoke right now
CJ2 Haha no, tonight is just one of those evenings when it would be perfect
CJ2 Dealing with all this homework
CJ2 But this is why I wanna get some, because right now I just go over a friend's maybe every other week and smoke, but I can't just smoke here in my apartment

Sis The world bursts @ the seams w/ ppl ready to tell you you're not good enough. Some may be correct. But don't do their work. Seek any job; ask anyone out; pursue any goal. Don't take it personally if they say no, they may not be smart enough to say yes

Merrick not much. trying to get fedora to work without a CD. i'm booting via flash drive, but it keeps saying "invalid key"
Merrick so i'm messing around with stuff and fucking up my computer :P
Merrick yeah.
Merrick i think it's because i'm booting off my watch/ flash drive and it's not reading properly
Merrick i'm looking for something completely new. i have XP-interface Vista and i'm tired of looking at it
Merrick hmmmmm
Merrick i'll look into it
Merrick lol!
Merrick the big question: is it free?
Merrick thank g-d. i'm poor as an immigrant teacher.
Merrick why the underscores?
Merrick no caps?
Merrick no bold? italics?
Merrick any NORMAL ways of utilizing emphasis? lol
Merrick ah
Sis :P
Merrick heh. i prefer AIM. i like my graphics :-D
Merrick such as the smileys that just bounced on my screen XD

Merrick my computer is great; my internet connection is stolen.
Merrick that'd help
Merrick sorry. explained
Merrick my internet
Merrick phyb3r2011 (23:40:04): or install itself side-by-side w/ windows as a dual boot option, with an option to uninstall ubuntu through windows add/remove programs
Merrick that's what i got last
Merrick right
CJ Faggot
CJ FAGGOT
Merrick i wonder; do you think my 1G RAM would be able to handle both Vista (a half-cleared version, long story) and Ubuntu together?
CJ I bet you like nascar too
CJ BUDWIESER FUCK YEAH LESS GO MUDDIN' GET THE BIG TIRES WHITE BITCHES AND FUCK YEAH
CJ #!linux rawks
CJ openbox sexiness on my laptop
CJ Using like 150MB / 3GB RAM on it hahaha
Merrick sry
Merrick you were saying?
Merrick right
Merrick man i hope so
Merrick whoo!
Merrick how fast? if i get it sent to Israel, i have to pay a shit-ton to get it cleared through customs
Merrick which do I get: desktop or server? i'm on a laptop, so i'm wary of eather
Merrick *either
Merrick just checking
Merrick which means i have to get it shipped to here in Israel.
Merrick oh well
Merrick a tad. to get new things shipped here, i have to pay money to clear it through customs. 
Merrick $100 of stuff from ThinkGeek cost me about that much in clearning customs as well.
Merrick they're assholes.
CJ Yeah
CJ No it sounds like it's RAM which means it kills your battery if you use it
Merrick יופי. sent :-D
CJ Kill is the wrong word
CJ Uses your battery if you use it
CJ I'm not, however
CJ I have 3GB
CJ I'm using 150MB
CJ Well with buffers like 350MB but either way
CJ It is ubuntu
CJ The difference is the default set of packages, and a few config scripts are custom
CJ It runs openbox instead of gnome
CJ And compositing is provided by xcompmgr
CJ I don't have animations but I couldn't run compiz on that thing before I doubt I can now
CJ It'll do shadows and fade windows in
CJ Gonna mount /tmp as a ramfs :O
CJ Aye
Merrick whoo! thanks
CJ And I have mah sexy conky on it
Sis ok, finally back to my room
Sis lol, 
Sis in the loft with ken
Merrick so how are the classes going? 
Merrick i'm alright. kinda chilly
Sis good
CJ Whoa buddy
CJ I'm not gay
CJ Sandy clause
CJ FAGGY CLAUSE
Sis umm, it's not lol
Sis yeppers
Sis but i have the book open
Sis i hate econ
Sis it's icky
Sis online problems
Sis yeppers
Sis yea
Sis i'm 1/2 done wiht econ
Sis and starving
Sis seeing as i was starving at lunch, and got an omlet
Sis and only ate 1/2 of it
Sis and then had starbucks at like 1
Sis so yea, no real food since subs last nihgt
Sis nopoe
Sis idk
Sis yep
Sis you do that
Sis idk
Sis i hate econ
Sis oh i still do
Sis econ is done
Sis i think
Sis good
Sis dial run
Sis umm, question
Sis since when does kevin hang out wiht kathleen and kaylin???
Sis i'm just confused how they know each oter
Sis b/c kevin and kathleen have this message thred on his status i nkotice
Sis d
Sis and then the 3 of them are all in the dial
Sis kathleen and kevin fence togehter
CJ2 Call me george foreman cuz I'm sellin everybody grills
Sis lol yea
Sis lol yea
CJ2 Got thirty down at the bottom, 30 mo at the top
Sis haha 
Sis nice
CJ2 hahaha
CJ2 http://imagebin.ca/view/BPhYEtU.html
CJ2 It's teh sex
CJ2 Because it came with it
CJ2 So until I learn them all
CJ2 I'm leaving it
CJ2 They aren't even all correct anymore because I changed like half
CJ2 I guess I should just remove it haha
CJ2 Yeah it came with conky and that config installed
CJ2 It had a few other specs like CPU but I removed 'em
Sis looks only work from ppl like amanda
Sis lol
Sis i'm an attention whore
CJ2 I do like it's method of auto-start over gnome's, it executes ~/.config/openbox/autogen.sh
CJ2 Which means I can modify it easier
CJ2 http://crunchbanglinux.org/
CJ2 The other real cool thing is
CJ2 From the time you finish typing your password until everything's fully loaded
CJ2 Is literally like 1 second
CJ2 I suggest throwing it on your netbook, that's what many of the #! users have
CJ2 Yeah the bottom bar is "tint"
CJ2 The other neat thing is that it's got GTK and such so you can install the same apps mostly
CJ2 Crunchbang
Sis she's in my room
CJ2 :D
CJ2 Fucking uses so little RAM
CJ2 Like 2GB installed
CJ2 A bit lighter than Ubuntu too
Sis kathleen, kevin and kaylin
CJ2 But the speediness of it is the best
Sis idk visiting amy
CJ2 I'm quite a fan of openbox now too
CJ2 ~/.config/openbox/rc.xml to modify like everything about your DE is epic win
CJ2 All the hotkeys are in there
CJ2 I haven't tried compiz yet
CJ2 Not planning on it either
CJ2 Desktop Environment
CJ2 Technically it has no DE (GNOME and KDE are DEs)
CJ2 Technically openbox is the WM and it uses the gdm script as a DE, but for all intents openbox would be your "DE"
CJ2 No hehe
CJ2 I have a heavy rig and I take advantage of it there
CJ2 But on my laptop resources aren't so plentiful
CJ2 I also figured out how to change the CPU scaling threshold
CJ2 So when I'm not doing anything it scales it down to 1000MHz
CJ2 I dunno, it's certainly not a good replacement for my desktop OS at home but I may think about it for work, and overall I'm _very_ impressed with it
CJ2 I half got gnome-do running, except there's a bug in docky from the PPA and the latest bzr version doesn't build on mono 1.9.1 yet so nobody can fucking build it from source haha
CJ2 Oh?
CJ2 I forget who he plays
CJ2 For work because I have a piece of shit DX10 card
CJ2 So the visuals are very sluggish
CJ2 I like compiz for WM features and openbox properly emulates many of them
CJ2 Uhm yeah :P
CJ2 Except when I have people over and I go to type something and porn starts coming up
CJ2 But other than that :P
CJ2 Hahaha
CJ2 Who did you think it was?
CJ2 Sweet
CJ2 You should give it to me
CJ2 MINE
CJ2 Well that's no big deal
CJ2 HD or HD upconvert
CJ2 What's the source that you're streaming
CJ2 HD is easily done with a decent network, but it's still impressive to do lag-free
Sis ok
Sis all good
CJ2 So you're streaming SD?
CJ2 That's no big deal
CJ2 :P
CJ2 Stream 1080p HD :O
CJ2 That'll raep shitty networks
CJ2 Hehe
CJ2 My network rawks
CJ2 I can stream 1080p HD from desktop to laptop via wifi
CJ2 FreeBSD distro entirely meant for being a router
CJ2 And tint is the panel along the bottom
CJ2 Normal setup is to have the panel at the top along the bottom with the window list in the empty space there
CJ2 I moved it up and use tint for window list until I can get docky working
CJ2 Btw, dd + gzip + nc = epic backup solution
CJ2 Desktop: nc -l 9999 > laptop.disk.image.gz   -   Laptop: dd if=/dev/sda8 | gzip -cf | nc 192.168.0.10:9999
CJ2 Backup my hard partition bit for bit :D
Sis so i'm talking to bryce
Sis online
Sis and he's just like, do you like me?
Sis great
Sis i love my life
CJ2 I SEE YOU TYPING
Sis smarty0613 (7:53:00 PM): i thought that's what you were going to ask. i really don' know what happened last night. 
Sis i was just hangin out and having fun, and then the whole hand thing started. i know i should have probably done something about it, 
Sis  but honestly it was nice and relaxing. this morning included
Sis i'm sorry if that sent you the wrong message. i don't like you like that, atleast not right now.
Sis i just want to take some time and figure things out for me.
Sis he hasn't responded
Sis so idk if that's good or bad
CJ2 I just can't quit looking at my laptop
CJ2 So fucking sexy
CJ2 Not yet, I'm stuck between versiosn
CJ2 The latest doesn't build on 1.9.1 yet, and the latest stable has a bug
CJ2 For me anyway
Sis yea
CJ2 gnome-do's latest stable is 0.8, there's a bug in docky that affects me where I can't enable the dock
Sis thansk
CJ2 But the developers build against mono 2.0, not 1.9.1
Sis no, why
CJ2 And the rest of the ubuntu world has 1.9.1
Sis you mean the dial
CJ2 So we can't build it from source yet
Sis brb
CJ2 Can't / don't feel like looking up how
CJ2 I'm sure building mono from source would be a giant beast to tackle
CJ2 Eh?
CJ2 What does?
Sis back
CJ2 Ooooooh
CJ2 As opposed to secondary output from main PC
CJ2 You're saying primary output for miniPC
Sis smarty0613 (7:55:41 PM): what's your take on, because you seemed to like it too
Sis "Bryce H" (8:02:28 PM): yes i enjoyed it and once i got to grace i layed there and was like why cant it still be the  morning. but im the oppisite of you i like you 
Sis 
CJ2 I see
CJ2 YEah I would imagine it would look better
Sis that's mean
Sis ye
Sis yea
Sis smarty0613 (8:06:50 PM): i'm not saying that i dont' like you, i'm just saying not right now, 
Sis  i'm not sure about anything, but i didn't want to leave this morning either. 
Sis  i've just had a lot of emotional stuff going on, and i just dont' want to stretch myself anymore right now. 
Sis smarty0613 (8:08:02 PM): you're a great guy bryce, don't get me wrong, but now is just not a good time for me to be in a relationship, i'm sorry
Sis i dont' know what to do
CJ2 I hump your face
CJ2 I put on my robe and wizard hat
Sis i know
Sis and i hope he understnands that i am not saying it wouldn't work, just not now
CJ2 lol
CJ2  So I dragged that little couch over to my desk
Sis i've just had so much with all the guys and then just with all my changes in life right now
CJ2 lolwut
Sis kevin, andrew, tim, stress from jj, and others
Sis and then changes with li, and all my busyness that seems to pull me every direction
Sis "Bryce H" (8:11:54 PM): its ok, if you tell me you like me ill wait till you think you can have a relationship
CJ2 hahaha
CJ2 IT'S NOT FUCKING FUNNY
CJ2 What break?
CJ2 Work vacation?
CJ2 OR what?
Sis yea
Sis he's from woostere
Sis wooster
CJ2 Whenever
CJ2 I have 80 hours to use for this year, I already have christmas taken care of
CJ2 And I used 4 of them for LoG
CJ2 I don't get a break from school this year except summer
CJ2 Becuase I'm taking all accelerated courses
CJ2 So whenever I take a break it's just up to me
CJ2 I gotta put in request at work then make sure it's not on a test day or something
CJ2 Are weekends typically pretty boring up there?
CJ2 I could like take a Friday off and head up there one Friday morning and just come back on a Sunday
CJ2 I typically avoid scheudling Friday courses so that shouldn't be an issue
CJ2 Nope :D
CJ2 Thank god :D
CJ2 Hahahah
Sis smarty0613 (8:16:34 PM):bryce, i do like you, but right now, i don't know how much more than a friendship that is. 
Sis i don't want to lead you on and tell you that it's going to work out, because it might not. 
Sis  i've had a lot of things going on in my life lately with new responsibilities and relationships with ppl, 
Sis and i just need to take a step back for me. i understand if you want to wait to see if it will work out, 
Sis  but i can't make any guarentees, and i don't wnat you waiting for something that might not happen, 
Sis  when you could be missing another great opportunity. you can do what you want, but i dont' know when i'm going to be ready, 
Sis and i don't want to put you through that.
Sis i think that's a good way to answer it
Sis i hop
Sis hope*
Sis really?
CJ2 Yeah, I either have to make it like this upcoming weekend or the weekend after, or wait for 3 weeks until I schedule my next classes before planning
CJ2 Jesus devry has their shit all over the place
CJ2 General campus info: devry.edu
Sis let's hope
CJ2 Student-specific info and control panel: my.devry.edu
CJ2 Academic calendar: devrycols.edu
CJ2 Online classes and shell: devryu.net
CJ2 Er, calendar and campus are backward but still
CJ2 4 fucking domains guys, come on
Sis "Bryce H" (8:24:32 PM): but wht if you are my great opportunity

CJ http://dmsuperman.pastebin.com/f12bb2eb6
CJ http://cjohnson.me/Draft2.pdf

CJ Anyway, class begins
CJ Holla.
Sis hw
Sis guess what??
Sis you aren't guessing
Sis did you leave me
Sis brian moore is single lol
Sis i also learned that he's like 3 1/2 years older than me
Sis but a junior.??
Sis the hockey webpage says his bday is jan 1985
Sis so that puts him at like 24?
Sis that can't be right
Sis fb says he's in the bg 2010 network
Sis that's not nice
Sis i know
Sis it says he's part of the honors program
Sis ok, so then he can't be that old right?
Sis the hockey site says his bday's jan 28, but has not a single post on his fb abt it
Sis i'm very confused
Sis  oh well, not worth my stalker skills today
Sis dial run
Sis back
Sis they have mashpotatoes
Sis dial run
CJ Hahaha
CJ Some dude is trying to show me how much "better" his Q6600 is than my E8400
CJ Knowing full well it's hardly a reasonable test, I told him to time his pi calculations to a million digits
CJ He got 8seconds
CJ I got 4 :O
Kim hi
Sis dial run
Sis I am away from my computer right now.
Sis back in a few
Sis no again
Sis i didn't get much earlier
CJ Hmm?
CJ Oh hehe
CJ sudo apt-get install tint
CJ Er, I think it's tint2
CJ No, that's just the window list applet, I removed that applet, moved the panel to the top, and installed tint
CJ Make sure to add it to ~/.config/openbox/autostart.sh so it autostarts ;)
CJ Just "tint" iirc
CJ And config is .config/tint iirc
CJ ~
CJ Dude, I'm sure you're probably sick of hearing it
CJ But you have no idea how amped for this show I am
Sis back
CJ I swear to fuck I can't listen to anything else
CJ I'll listen for like an hour and just come back
CJ They only have 5 albums
CJ I already know them all (except their first one as Burn the Priest) inside out
CJ I downloaded Killadelphia and that was even worse
CJ I'm hearing them live
CJ They sound the EXACT same
CJ And even better because you hear him screaming to get the crowd to make insane moshpits
Sis lol
CJ I haven't even listened to Metallica for a week
CJ And that's nuts, becuase I've listened to Metallica at least 340 days a year for the past 3 years :P
Sis ranch chicken pizza and mozeralla sticks
CJ And if that's an exaggeration it's only barely
Sis oh, did i tell you kevin is offically dating kathleen?
Sis i said i was going to the dial, i thought that's what you meant
Sis oh, i couldnt' remember
Sis span and studying for acct
Sis still behind reading
CJ God you fail
CJ Haha
Sis nice
CJ openbox config is ~/.config/openbox/rc.xml
CJ Hotkeys, desktops, a few panel settings, mouse
CJ All that's in there
CJ Super
CJ Aye
CJ tar czvf wrath.tar.gz ./*mp3 ./*jpg
CJ scp wrath.tar.gz dmsuperman.com:/tmp/
CJ Just copied the album from work machine here :d
CJ No idea, I use shares-admin
CJ I'd imagine in like /etc/samba or the like
CJ :P
CJ /etc/samba/smb.conf
CJ Don't think there is one, search for ToggleShade in rc.xml though
CJ eh?
CJ Oh, that's the mouse one
CJ So that's a no
CJ Gotta add one
CJ Add another keybind
CJ <keybind key="W-z">
CJ <action something="ToggleShade" />
CJ </keybind>
CJ I don't remmeber what the param for the action is, look at the other ones
CJ No I know that
CJ But I have "something" in there
CJ I don't remember what the attribute name is
CJ Root menu -> Prefs -> Openbox -> Restart
CJ Terminator is pretty neat, it does split terminals
CJ But I just installed gnome-terminal becuase I'm already used to Ctrl + Shift + V for paste and I like the sexy transparency
CJ g-t's a memory hog though
CJ Like 10MB per instance
CJ On my desktop the memory usage is outrageous
CJ My IM term uses FIFTY FIVE megs of ram
CJ IRC is using 19
CJ exit
CJ Haha wrong win
CJ You did it twice
CJ :P
CJ Yup, within 24 hours :P
CJ But yeah
CJ Find terminator
CJ Replace with gnome-terminal :P
CJ Also root -> preferences -> openbox -> applications or some such
CJ There's two places, that just changes the hotkey
CJ You wanna change default term too
CJ quantum of solace on bd yet?
CJ I wanna I wanna I wanna :(
CJ I can download a BD rip though
CJ ~/.fonts
CJ May not exist yet
CJ That's a freedesktop thing, not just ubuntu
CJ Fucking movie's still making money in the box office
CJ It was, however, the second most commercially successful Bond film, earning GB£50 million in product placement, and grossing US$570,001,405 at the box office as of 8 February 2009.
CJ Wish I made bond money :(
CJ Gonna guess Casino Royale
CJ The film premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on 29 October 2008, gathering mixed reviews which mainly praised Craig's gritty performance and the film's action sequences while feeling that Quantum of Solace was not as impressive as the predecessor Casino Royale.

CJ2 "This next one's called NNYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHWWWWWWWWWWW"
CJ2 And then it comes into the track called "Get To The Choppa"

CJ2 Cleveland band iirc
CJ2 04/21
CJ2 Fuck yeah bash + ffmpeg
CJ2  ls ./*flac | xargs -I'{}' ffmpeg -ab 320000 -i {} {}.mp3
CJ2 Converts my entire flac directory into mp3 8-)
CJ2 ls ./*flac
CJ2 Outputs all the flac filesi n the dir
CJ2 "| xargs -I'{}'" is just for passing stdin as arguments to other commands
CJ2 So then ffmpeg -ab 320000 -i file.flac file.flac.mp3  is what's executed for each output of the ls command
CJ2 320k so yeah
CJ2 Fucking takes like 1 second to convert a track
CJ2 Actually, refined: find . -name "*flac" -print0 | xargs -0 -I"{}" ffmpeg -i {} -ab 320k {}.mp3
CJ2 First one didn't like single quotes, so I used null to separate them instead
CJ2 You guys think they all sound teh same?
CJ2 Of course tehy sound the same
CJ2 They all sound BRUTAL!!!
CJ2 These are better anyway
CJ2 It's the vocalist, not the guitarist

CJ2 3 of them are me haha
CJ2 I'm actually listening to it, 1. I'm also ripping it twice
CJ2 I started ripping it at teh beginning of the show, splitting each track up into a separate file
CJ2 Then I realized I wanted a single MP3, so I started a second rip
CJ2 But he wants a copy of what it sounds like to the outside world so I kept the first one going for him so he'll have the whole set
CJ2 He actually has a pretty sweet setup, he runs the whole thing from his house and he has a crap internet connection
CJ2 He has a relay shoutcast server which we're all connected to on his friend's computer (hodclan.net)
CJ2 He streams to it, it streams to all of us
CJ2 He's actually only just started but yeah I can if you like
CJ2 Puh

CJ2 March 20/21
Sis nm
Sis you
Sis hmm
Sis i'm bored
Sis don't laugh at me
Sis you just did
CJ FUCK YEAH
CJ BIG TIRES
CJ Did you see that link about the wallpc?
CJ http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/02/24/1918217&from=rss
CJ Fucking epic win
Sis anyway
CJ YEah dude
CJ Fuck yeah
CJ 5 watt
CJ 1.2GHz ARM CPU
CJ 512MB DDR2 RAM
CJ 512MB NAND Flash storage
CJ RJ45
CJ USB
CJ Buttsex
CJ No it's very small
CJ If you're wanting to use this as an actual machine you'll want to wait until the next version which is supposed to have SATA and PCI-e x1
CJ x1 not x16
CJ x1 is _tiny_
CJ It's barely bigger than USB
CJ Well my plan is to use one + a switch as my router
CJ Another one for a server
CJ With a USB attached storage
Sis sup
Sis gotcha
Sis email
Sis getting dressed for the day
Sis it's bum day
Sis nothing to do but shcool and homeowkr, and no one to impress
Sis sure we'll go with that
Sis but i have no church today, and so i can do whatevs, and can look ugly if i want to
Sis off to class, ttyl
CJ Flash drive
CJ 8GB
CJ Hey
CJ I need to be certain before I make this request
CJ I wanna come up March 21, 22, and 23
CJ I gotta be sure before I come up that that's a good weekend (+monday)
CJ So let mwkno so I can make this request
CJ HAha
CJ I do that all the time
CJ Stick it in her pooper
CJ I shall
CJ I doubt it
CJ But I'll see if I can bring my friend's gun
CJ Which I would have told you about but he hasn't written the article up
CJ With a sprinkler release, PVC, and pop bottles he's built a gun that you pump with a bike pump
CJ Until we build out the microcontrolled release it's single shot since you can't trigger with your finger fast enough
CJ It shoots a nerf dart a few hundred feet
CJ Then the barrel comes off and you can use it as a blow gun
CJ Dude fuck yeah
CJ I tested a point blank shot
CJ It actually stings a little
CJ Took one to the chest
CJ :P
CJ Know where somebody can get a new $100 PC?
CJ He only wants to browse the internets
CJ Ubuntu is acceptable
CJ But he's barely computer literate so nothing harder :P
CJ Hahaha
CJ For serious though
CJ My mac book pro suggestion isn't going over too well
CJ That's where I'm looking, I'd prefer something new though
CJ I know there has to be
CJ It was sarcastic :P
CJ They have $200 netbooks
CJ They surely have the equivalent $100 piece of garbage desktop
CJ Dude plug PC
CJ Pair of 'em
CJ Compatibility with existing garbage MS apps, you mean
CJ Compatibility itself is perfectly feasible with linux
CJ The two plug PCs could be your router and your server
CJ Right, that's what I said
CJ :P
CJ pfSense
CJ Switch
CJ $30
CJ Internet to switch, router to switch
CJ Tell the router to get an IP
CJ Then the only thing left to do DHCPOFFER is the router
CJ DHCP server
CJ Actually I'm not sure
CJ HAhahah
CJ Perhaps you need a dual nic
CJ PCI-e x1 in v2 of the plug PC though :O
CJ Hopefully by then it'll be done
CJ PCI-e x1 has NICs
CJ Well the plug PC has gigabit
CJ So the overhead is negligible
CJ Alright time to take my final
CJ I'll talk to you in like an hour
CJ Back
CJ Jesus fuck he talks forever
CJ So I doubt the answer will be yes
CJ But a friend is throwing a kegger March 14
CJ If you'd like you can roll down and hit it up
CJ Alright
CJ I'm hookin' the bitch up wif music
CJ Party noobeh
CJ Fuck yeah
CJ Then I'll head up there the following weekend
CJ shall be balla
CJ I think once I master beat matching I could do amateur DJing
CJ Whatever. You have class?
CJ And the monday is fine too? OR do you have class all day?
CJ Balla
CJ I can just chill somewhere
CJ I can sit there and molest your mom
CJ Haha
CJ I can't think of a good reason for blocking anything, so you're asking the wrong person :P
CJ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43pkqeamXe8
CJ Pretty cool song haha
CJ A bit nothing :P
CJ You can get a netbook for that price
CJ And netbooks are already overpriced :P
CJ The difference between 3W and 15W is negligible
CJ Most netbooks consumption is well under 50W
CJ Depending on which one
CJ Asher something?
CJ Honestly just wait
CJ You're too far out to even be looking
CJ You knkow how fast tech moves
CJ What you find today will be "garbage" by that time
CJ Exactly :P
CJ By the time you go to make a purchase this will be old news
CJ I'd look at an eeebox and the plug pc
CJ if the pci-e model releases before you make your purchase than I'd _easily_ say pick that up
CJ I have some too
CJ That second model has SATA as well :O
CJ You could do router + web/irssi/bitlbee server dude
CJ Easy
CJ Fucking mounted to your wall
CJ Meh
CJ I'd do that on a separate one if at all
CJ I'd only do it with a massive drive attached via SATA
CJ Definitely not USB
CJ Honestly if you have something like that I'd go with a larger machine
CJ Simply for the larger number of bays and SATA ports
CJ I'm saying for more than one drive it's gonna suck
CJ Well yeah
CJ rsync + cron = winful
CJ Nightly sync of any new deleted and changed files
Tifa andy why dont we have facebook.
Tifa ?
Tifa youre tech support
Tifa :p
Tifa Come on down to the other side, come with us to the gates of hell.  We will drag you from where you are to where you belong...
CJ Timer? Psh
CJ Keep it running 24/7
Tifa lol ok
CJ It wouldn't use a damned thing :P
Tifa how do you know it has nothing to do with that?
CJ hahaha
Tifa lmao
Tifa i love you andy
Tifa :-D
Tifa heh
Tifa its ok
Tifa "sheeple"
Tifa i found my new fav word
Tifa there are a lot of sheeple around
CJ Fucking fail and a half
CJ Jesus
CJ It's facebook
Tifa hehe
CJ Chill out
CJ It's a garbage website anyway
CJ I like that I can keep in touch using it
CJ That's literally the only reason I like it
Tifa its just my opinion, but steve is good at collecting sheeple
CJ faggotry
Tifa its...disturbing at times
Tifa i spose
CJ Figure out how to continue it for weeks
CJ Ubuntu
CJ Ubuntu
CJ :P
CJ Don't run compiz and you're set
CJ Which remote
CJ You already have one?
CJ XBMC comes with mappings for the microsoft media center remote
CJ Just install lirc
CJ Ah, firefly
CJ It might have bindings for that too, ask in the irc chan
CJ mibbit.com!
CJ lol
CJ My friend used it today
CJ He said at one point hte memory usage was _higher_ than firefox AND eclipse COMBINED
CJ Then started to come back down
CJ xming?
CJ lolwut
CJ X client?
CJ Or full X server?
CJ Heh
CJ Windows wishes they had something as intelligently designed (though better coded) as X
CJ X is mostly stable but it has its issues
CJ 90% of X issues are driver-related though
CJ Hahaha
CJ Also, finally done
CJ 90 tracks for the party
CJ Collected, downloaded, sorted into a decent play order and renamed
CJ Forwarded X is X client, not X server
CJ OR did you forward TO the mini PC
CJ Neat
CJ So it ran your windows eclipse on your miniPC? Or a linux version of eclipse?
CJ Oh, see if it can forward windows apps
CJ If it just does linux apps then that's dumb haha
CJ That's what I'm saying
CJ There's no advantage
CJ If you could forward windows apps you could use it to run windows apps on linux
CJ Alt + the tab number
CJ /win winnumber
CJ And there's a wnn.pl script floating around to do partial channel name matches
CJ So like /wnn off for offtopic
CJ Starts at 1
CJ http://www.demonoid.com/files/details/1761175/4453540/

Sis night
Sis noppers
Sis we both had exams and i had to talk to a professor
Sis group projects
Sis apparently not well if i'm talkign to him
Sis the kid that doesn't do anything....
Sis decided to do something
Sis after we already made up for him not doing any work, we go to present this morning and meghan has the ppt, and he's like no i have the ppt, so the slides were out of order and we looked like we weren't prepared
Sis and we sucked
Sis and it's all his fault
Sis yeah i didn't want to make a scene in class, by saying, no, we're not using your's becuase it's wrong, i just was like fine whatever
Sis and i knoew we missed points because of not knowing what was up
Sis and i don't feel we should get penalized because we were prepared till that happened
Sis so i went and talked to him about it, and told him that the kid didn't come to any meetings
Sis he's like, yea that doesn't suprise me, (cuse the kid skipps class all the time to) and he's like, i can't do anthing about the points now, but just remember to document everything on the evals at the end of the semester and if this same thing starts to happen with the next project let me know and we can try to fix the situation
Sis and he can redistribute points at the end of the semester, like take points from him and give them to me and the other two
Sis yeah, prof put us in groups and we ahve two group projects
Sis yea you're tellin me
Sis what was that
Sis ok lol
Sis nice lol
Sis working on stuff
Sis nacurh app
Sis you know it
Sis and eating goldfishes
Sis don't make fun of me, i love goldfish
Sis becuase it's easy
Sis i thought you said why woud
Sis would
Sis idk, you do sometimes, but not mean like
Sis the question:1)      Tell me about what it means to be a leader here on campus, and how being a leader has helped you define who you are:
Sis my answer...
Sis To me a leader on campus is simply anyone that wants to help improve the quality of our campus, whether through individuals or communities. A leader is one who has a goal in mind and does everything s/he can to achieve that goal. A leader is a role model and a friend to everyone. A leader is anyone who is able to be a resource to other students and administrators and help them in their leadership journey as well. I feel a
Sis leader should be able to be unbiased and listen to what others have to say and make the better choice that will help more people in the long run than just the quick and easy choice. 
Sis Throughout the last three and a half semesters at Bowling Green, I have working with a number of organizations and groups and held a number of different roles. In many of these activities I have been a worker; the student that is behind the scenes doing a large amount of work with much dedication and little recognition. I have been on numerous committees and helped to plan events and activities. This has taught me that
Sis leaders do not always get the recognition they deserve but they still know what they did and have pride in doing so. 
Sis  
Sis Additionally, I have been the head of groups and on the main board. Within my hall council, I sit on executive board and planned our hall council retreat. I was on the planning committee for Falcon’s Gold and played a large role in that event. Currently with RSA I am working on the plans for the spring retreat. Being the head of a group has shown me that with leadership comes responsibility and the need for
Sis collaboration. Being a leader here on campus has enabled me to work well with others and be responsible for my actions; I have other people I have to relay information to, and I cannot procrastinate on work. I feel my friendly personality and organization skills have resulted from my leadership roles I have taken on while at BGSU. 
Sis  
Sis what do you think
Sis say waht
Sis ok, just a sec
Sis did you only get that or did you get the first part
Sis oh gotcha
Sis thanks, i wasn't sure where to go withit, but that sounded good
Sis 2 more questions
Sis 1)      What would you do with the resources you gained from this conference, and how would you adapt them to our campus here at BG?
Sis  
Sis I feel our campus is lacking support and representation within hall councils. Many halls have been struggling to keep attendance and morale up at meetings as well as getting residents excited for programs. I would hope that from this conference I can take the resources I gain and go back to the hall councils with new and different ways to get residents involved. I feel I will gain a bigger sense of community and support
Sis from this conference and that is an important factor for halls to know as well. I know there will be programs on group dynamics and community development and that is what I would be focusing on. I hope that through my experience I can interest others to get involved as well. 
Sis what's true
Sis that ther's no support
Sis yea one was all the posts, and idk the other 
Sis it's alll good, it's not important
Sis i'm gonna go take a shower, so i'll tytl
Sis crazy day, taking a shower to relax

Sis http://www.falconradio.org/index.html
Sis lol
CJ2 Fuckyeah 9 days
CJ2 I think it's gonna be epic
Sis soon, but the show is fun to listen to
CJ2 God damn it I hate trolls
CJ2 I hate trolls that are in real life :(
CJ2 I met this guy in #u-o
CJ2 Turns out he lives in c-bus
CJ2 So I met up with him one day
CJ2 He uses linux, seemed alright, etc.
CJ2 So we've hung out like 3 times now
CJ2 And talked via AIM a bit more
CJ2 Every single time we've talked or hung out
CJ2 The conversation has turned into one of a few subjects:
CJ2 How linux sucks, because of his bad experience with X Y or Z
CJ2 How linux sucks because of other people's good experiences with windows
CJ2 How OS X is the best OS ever because it has software that no other OS has (and he's not talking about audio/video which OS X actually does have the upper hand in)
CJ2 How windows is better than linux, and typically runs better than linux
CJ2 How I'm wrong in X Y or Z because he knows all about X Y AND Z
CJ2 For instance, he "finally" got Ubuntu working the other day, and asked me about wallpapers across dual monitors
CJ2 You can truly believe in what you troll :P
CJ2 Anyway, I told him nautilus is drawing it and sucks at it, use compiz if it's an issue or gimp it
CJ2 So today he starts a convo, first thing is roughly "so gnome sucks, xfce does it way better, i didn't do it with compiz, compiz sucks"
CJ2 That somehow turned into thunar > nautilus for fm management, I merely stated that I prefer bash/zsh for filemanagement
CJ2 Hehe
CJ2 You can believe in something and purposely bring it up to start fights
CJ2 But once I stated that my preference is shell it went on to "the shell can't do anything" and "if you don't know what you want you can't use it" and then "I have much much more music than you"
CJ2 I was like wtf does that last one even have to do with anything
CJ2 Then he blocked me hahahaha
CJ2 So I blocked him, hopefully he'll wait a few days, unblock me, then jus tthink I'm not online
CJ2 Hahahah
CJ2 The problem is like the first time we hung out before I realized he was a major douche I invited him to our LAN party
Sis ok, i'm off to bed, i'll ttyl
CJ2 HELP ME ANDY
CJ2 I need you to call him and stalk him and make him move to kentucky within the next 3 days
CJ2 GO!
Sis night
CJ2 ...because you're andy!
CJ2 Also because then we can finally be together
CJ2 Forever
CJ2 I think charter one's mistaken
CJ2 I got this Green$ense thing, my card is replaced with a white/green one, and my statements are sent via email instead of paper
CJ2 For helping, they pay me $0.10 per transaction
CJ2 Last month, they depositing $12.00
CJ2 This month it was $6.00
CJ2 The month before last was $18.00
CJ2 I know I'm not making that many transactions haha
CJ2 Oh also my insurance is _finally_ fucking going down
CJ2 $80 a month
CJ2 As opposed to the $115 I was paying before
Sis amy's on the air

Sean both of those say you can't use ASp because it works serverside instead of client side
Sean i found a possible way to make it work using checkboxes, ill just have to make the other page check if you have too many chosen (he wants a limit of 5 chosen
Sean if that does not do it for him ill have to point out the error he made
Sean cause we cant use java and that is the only(or easyest) way to make it work
Sean yeah, we've noticed

Sis idk
Sis im having a good day
Sis so it might happen
Sean cua
Sean cya*
Sis kk
Sis bye
Sis bye bye
Sis what's
Sis that
CJ2 Hey, just FYI
CJ2 I interact with my website entirely through SSH
CJ2 I really don't want to open any other ports
CJ2 So my plan is to give you a restricted SSH user
CJ2 And allow you to port forward the mysql port
CJ2 This way you can use whatever tool you like to manage the DB
CJ2 Uh, ok
CJ2 Is this going to be year-round?
CJ2 Yeah I'd prefer that
CJ2 Invoice
Sis sup
CJ2 :D
CJ2 You on a linux machine?
Sis i want my brother back
CJ2 Hehe
CJ2 ssh -p 33445 aross@cjohnson.me
Sis sup
CJ2 Haha I know
CJ2 SSH runs on port 33445, not default 22
CJ2 Your password should be "$#@!1234a"
CJ2 You can change it by entering passwd iirc
CJ2 Does it work?
Sis tryin to get a pig
CJ2 Shouldn't be
CJ2 It's essentially real-time everywhere I've used it
Sis gotcha
CJ2 Yeah
CJ2 that's the only port it's open on
CJ2 I'm even logged in as you right now
CJ2 I have no lag :O
CJ2 SSH :D
CJ2 sftp / scp
Sis i got a pig!
CJ2 If you're on Ubuntu, sudo apt-get install sshfs
CJ2 My setup is basically this:
CJ2 I have /media/cjohnson.me
Sis yeppers
CJ2 Permissions are 0777 on it
CJ2 I have a command "hostfs" which is aliased to "sshfs -p 33445 dmsuperman@cjohnson.me:/storage/www/vhosts /media/cjohnson.me/"
CJ2 Your path will be slightly different
CJ2 I haven't set it up yet
CJ2 Also I have my SSH public key in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
CJ2 ssh-keygen && ssh-keygen -t rsa
CJ2 Those will create your RSA and DSA public keys (RSA is typically what you want but some hosts use DSA only)
CJ2 And private keys
CJ2 Typically once you start SSH'ing all over teh place you want to keep these safe
CJ2 ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_dsa are your private keys, never share them
CJ2 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and id_dsa.pub are your public keys, these are acceptable to give to anybody
CJ2 Once you're logged in to the server, create ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and on the first line paste the contents of your id_rsa.pub
CJ2 Then you should be able to login withou password
CJ2 By default it wraps so make sure you put the whole thing on a single line
CJ2 No
CJ2 Then you have to enter it when it sends teh key
CJ2 Odd
CJ2 Yeah
CJ2 That's right
CJ2 It'll save your private key there
CJ2 And the public key in the same place
Sis so wha'ts up
CJ2 No
CJ2 Make ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
CJ2 It's a file
CJ2 On the server
CJ2 And inside it goes your public key
CJ2 Which, on your local machine, is the ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub that you just created
CJ2 What's the domain, btw?
CJ2 Any subdomains/
CJ2 Aye
Sis packed up my stuff for my mtgs and such,
Sis but still haven't studied, and ahve a headache
CJ2 http://www.bgsu.edu/studentlife/organizations/undead/
CJ2 Is that you on the right?
CJ2 In that picture?
CJ2 I see a big fruity mofo in orange hoody
CJ2 :P
CJ2 Right
Sis just did
CJ2 Well it's ready
CJ2 As soon as bgundead.com points at my nameservers it'll be up
CJ2 Nope
Sis just committee and then review for the exam
Sis tomorrow
CJ2 ns1.linode.com
Sis i have a piggy
CJ2 ns2.linode.com
CJ2 ns3.linode.com
CJ2 ns4.linode.com
CJ2 Well actually I still need to add the zonefile for it but yeah
CJ2 It should be good
CJ2 You should be able to port forward 3306 as well
CJ2 ssh -p 33445 -L3306:localhost:9999 cjohnson.me
Sis i've got 2
CJ2 All of those
CJ2 You typically set up redundant nameservers
CJ2 You'll notice in your home directory a bgundead.com folder
CJ2 That's the www folder for your site
CJ2 Woo I can get renter's insurance for $10/mo
CJ2 You get it when you rent an apartment
CJ2 If the building blows up
CJ2 They'll cover my shit
CJ2 Up to $15,000 worth
CJ2 And my vehicle insurance finally went down to $80/mo
Sis ok back to the union
Sis maybe i'll see you later
Sis union for committee meeting, and then LSC for exam review
Sis bye bro
Sis you're losing you know that right
Sis this is twice
Sis good luck sis, feel better?
Sis bye bye??
Sis figure out the right way to say good bye and you'll be winning
Sis or i'll stop talking
Sis better
Sis bye bro
CJ2 Hrm
CJ2 Odd I can do it in SSH
CJ2 Curious
CJ2 Wait on that
CJ2 I gotta do this invoice and set up the zonefile haha
CJ2 Alrigt
CJ2 Fuck I dunno
CJ2 What does an invoice look like
CJ2 For something like this
CJ2 Basically it'll be a simple "$10 a month for basic web hosting service, a single domain, single DB, X amount of transfer or so, X max memory usage, etc"
CJ2 I'd rather not
CJ2 Just because that means keeping track of shit
CJ2 :P
CJ2 ...uhm
CJ2 Ah, cool
CJ2 Either is good
CJ2 Who am I invoicing this too
CJ2 Address and such?
CJ2 Uh, what?
CJ2 How long is is the summer?
CJ2 When's it begin?
CJ2 I'm thinking for those months they can either pay in advance or pay after
CJ2 I'm just trying to avoid having to run it through you
CJ2 For 2 reasons: 1: It's really just a round-about way of payment
CJ2 And also 2: I know you're as forgetful as me
CJ2 Hahaha
CJ2 Hey I'm not badmouthing you
CJ2 I clearly said that I'm bad too
CJ2 :P
CJ2 Haha
CJ2 Either way, just the cover-my-ass bit
CJ2 This would seem funny if somebody had to question it
CJ2 I can do a custom invoice in May when they go away for months
CJ2 And who can I email this to?
CJ2 Alrighty then
CJ2 Hrm?
CJ2 Ah,
CJ2 :D
CJ2 1GB storage
CJ2 10GB transfer
CJ2 50MB RAM just for your app
CJ2 CPU usage needs to sit around average at least 80% of the time
CJ2 They're _much_ more than is required but limits are still required
CJ2 Yeah they're soft limits, I don't really care if they do as long as it's not excessively/repeatedly
CJ2 But my entire webserver has only used 0.5GB of transfer this month, my CPU sits below 1%, RAM _total_ is like 160MB, etc. etc.
CJ2 So you should be easily under all those limits
CJ2 Hehe
CJ2 I average about 2k hits per day
CJ2 Tons of people
CJ2 My blog gets good google coverage
CJ2 Plus my picture gallery
CJ2 I post picture links often and then people browse around
CJ2 My /b/ folder is frequented haha
CJ2 Oh yeah
CJ2 I have SEO out the ass
CJ2 That's what we sell at work, you can bet I'm going to get all the good tips and use 'em
CJ2 Search Engine Optimization
CJ2 I have my blog generate a sitemap.xml for google, keywords and metadata are on every page, my articles are full of hot words and external links
CJ2 My docky article is by far my biggest traffic generator
CJ2 Yeah
CJ2 Australia, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, UK, US, Congo
CJ2 I get hits from all over
CJ2 All the fucking congo IPs just try to spam my comments though hahaha
CJ2 I have anti-spam measures though, nothing gets through mwuahaha
CJ2 You mean that facebook API?
CJ2 I hate facebook
CJ2 I hate it automatically post my blog articles to facebook though
CJ2 have*
CJ2 And my linkedin account has it
CJ2 kotaku?
CJ2 Alrighty
CJ2 I'll finish this invoice and send you a copy
CJ2 If it looks good I'll send it
CJ2 Word.
CJ2 http://cjohnson.me/2009.03.05.pdf
CJ2 that look good?
CJ2 Also DB is setup
CJ2 Details are:
CJ2 DB: bgundead
CJ2 User: bgundead
CJ2 Pass: @aG2Asd5#aS28asFB
CJ2 To connect you'll need to forward the port via SSH
CJ2 ssh -p 33445 -L3306:localhost:9999 cjohnson.me
CJ2 Sorry, I mean:
CJ2 ssh -p 33445 -L3306:localhost:9999 aross@cjohnson.me
CJ2 That forwards localhost:9999 to 3306 on cjohnson.me
CJ2 So then use your favorite MySQL app (or just mysql command line) to connect to localhost:9999 and it'll connect to the MySQL server
CJ2 If that's not satisfactory let me know and I can get phpmyadmin or sqlbuddy up for you
Sis i beat the game

CJ2 With your parents?
CJ2 TITTY CLUB GET DRUNK FUCK YEAH
Sis yeppers
CJ2 I dunno, I wouldn't really go any place special with my parents
CJ2 There's nothing I would want to do that's special about turning 21 around my parents
CJ2 Just go to a good restaurant
CJ2 Cheesecake factory is tasty
CJ2 Even if I wasn't footing the bill I'd hate to go any place more expensive
CJ2 I hate places that are worse
CJ2 In Easton there's a place, Smith and Wolensky, 80 bucks for a steak
CJ2 Only if it comes with $70 cash as the dressing
CJ2 There isn't a fucking food in this world worth $80 for a single serving
CJ2 The keyword was "worth"
CJ2 Not consumer price ;)
CJ2 :O
CJ2 Gay
CJ2 Cheesecake Factory dude
CJ2 It's a nicer place to eat, typically with good sized portions and the prices are only inflated a bit relative to other places
CJ2 You can get a good meal like $12-$15
CJ2 Excluding drinks
CJ2 That's where I'd go anyway
CJ2 They have a wide range of food types
CJ2 There's on in legacy village up there, that's all I know of north
CJ2 :P
CJ2 No idea what that even is
CJ2 I see
CJ2 You could eat McDonald's
CJ2 FUCK YEAH
CJ2 FUCK YEAH!!!

CJ BANANAS
CJ So yeah
CJ Was still a little bit high this morning
CJ Didn't realize it until I got back home and I was entirely sober again
CJ That shit butters had was fucking...outrageous
CJ You remember the other andy? How high he was?
CJ Yeah he hung outside
CJ But you remember me pointing out that he was smashed?
CJ Yeah, he smokes a _lot_
CJ And butters shit fucked him up
CJ He came over, got high, and couldn't do anything but sit in front of that fire
CJ So somebody like me, you can imagine
CJ Not to mention sitting in your car and smoking...shit
CJ What, 2 1/2 bowls?
CJ Or just 1 1/2
CJ Yeah I only had like 10 beers throughout the night
CJ Yeah a few shots of the skittles at the beginning of the night
CJ I was fucking smashed
CJ I honestly had no idea how I had the energy to go walking around like I did
CJ I'd sit down and then get up and start headbanging
CJ This fucking lamb of god concert is going to be epic
CJ But try finding the debug switch and see if compiz gives you more verbose output
CJ I'm having terrible connection issues atm
CJ So I probably won't be a help
CJ Shit wrong person
Merrick dude. what in hell are you doing up so late on a monday morning?
Sis lol
Sis nm, just finished span, 
Sis listening to music
Sis you know
Sis you said fun fun
Sis and i saidk you kno
Sis said you know
Sis idk
Sis yea so
Sis good job
Sis \i'm off, i'll ttyl
CJ Yeah
CJ them fuckers they dun din't do dat shit dat they was supposed to
CJ Er
CJ 1: They still haven't paid me
CJ 2: You need to point the domain at my nameserver first
CJ Failure -_-
CJ What's the domain -_-
CJ "The Start Of Authority (SOA) E-mail address"
CJ Which email am I using here
CJ Dunno
CJ Done
CJ Theoretically you should be completely good to go now
CJ Assuming no hitches, which there should be none
CJ Just FYI (would be good to pass on to them, if possible), getting a check a week late is not a good way to begin a business deal -_-
CJ Thankies
CJ Yeah...
CJ I'd really hate to seem like a dick but if it's not on time in the future I won't deal with it, just boot 'em
CJ Hehe
CJ I figured
CJ On the upside, I somehow have gotten RAM usage even lower
CJ It was sitting around 160MB before, sits closer to 130MB max
CJ Tweaked some cache settings and such
CJ This motherfucker is a website serving MACHINE
CJ I'm pissed at mysql for not being able to help me figure out how to get it to open to a port-forwarded connection
CJ It works publically and through SSH, but not over an SSH port forward
CJ Downloaded As I Lay Dying's discography, they're going to be at the Lamb of God show
CJ They're pretty alright
CJ A bit too emo for my tastes but a bunch of their stuff is alright
CJ When he refrains from trying to sing he does well
CJ Address not found?
CJ Just DNS propogation for you, really
CJ It works for me
CJ I get an error
CJ Warning: mysql_connect() [function.mysql-connect]: Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES) in /home/aross/bgundead.com/core/coreHead.php on line 40
CJ You forgot to put in the proper connection details :O
CJ Yeah, it does for me
CJ I haven't cached the DNS request yet
CJ It's really just a waiting game until your ISP recaches
CJ mysqldump, I swear I've told you this before :P
CJ mysql -u whatever --pass='whatever' -h cjohnson.me dbname < the.dump.sql
CJ Username
CJ Unable to select database
CJ Seems to be good

CJ2 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6c80mlWMRA#t=1m30s
CJ2 The guitaring right there is pretty badass
CJ2 Actually from like 1:20 on
CJ2 It's kind of a break down
CJ2 Bro.
CJ2 13:09 <andrewross> dude
CJ2 13:10 <dmsuperman> Bro.
CJ2 mysql
CJ2 ...what issue
CJ2 Uh, just FYI
CJ2 Telling me about an issue before talking about it helps
CJ2 13:57 <andrewross> is that issue something on my side or something w/ the zonefile?
CJ2 13:58 <andrewross> if its the zonefile you can grab it when u get home
CJ2 13:58 <andrewross> no rush there
CJ2 That's all I have
CJ2 You never mentioned any issue with me
CJ2 All I got was "dude". I responded with "Bro".
CJ2 How about now
CJ2 K
CJ2 I want to show you a website
CJ2 http://no-www.org/
CJ2 The reason www.bgundead.com didn't work because it wasn't configured to work with any subdomains
CJ2 Which I asked you about before
CJ2 When in fact you wanted the "www" subdomain to be configured ;)
CJ2 Eh, yeah
CJ2 Ask who, you?
CJ2 I asked you initially if you wanted any subdomains, you said no
CJ2 18:49 <dmsuperman> Any subdomains/
CJ2 18:49 <andrewross> as in like whatever.bgundead.com?
CJ2 18:49 <dmsuperman> Aye
CJ2 18:50 <andrewross> no
CJ2 :P
CJ2 No, then I would have said "any subdomains other than www" :P
CJ2 Er, no
CJ2 :P
CJ2 I fucking hate www.
CJ2 It's the most stupid redundant thing ever
CJ2 And it wouldn't be so bad, except our admin keeps registering SSL certs to work with www., not the TLD
CJ2 If he would register for TLD, it would cascade and work on www
CJ2 But no, he registers for www. and forces me to go back into all the code and change it from TLD to www.
CJ2 :P
CJ2 God damn it
CJ2 I have a friend who knows a good deal about computers
CJ2 But if you try and get in depth he doesn't know much
CJ2 He's trying to argue with me that because he works at WoW (an ISP) he knows more about DHCP and similar technology than I do
CJ2 His job is to drive around and install cable
CJ2 If you can follow it
CJ2 Here's a pretty good way to describe the dimensions
CJ2 http://www.break.com/index/how-to-imagine-the-tenth-dimension.html
CJ2 A lot of things are entirely over simplified, of course
CJ2 But you get the general idea
CJ2 The difference is that infinity isn't really infinity
CJ2 Sorry, that's wrong
CJ2 7/8 area is where it's an infinite number of alternate versions of this universe
CJ2 9/10 is where it's an infinite number of universes
Sis what
Sis idk
Sis nope
Sis you said poke
