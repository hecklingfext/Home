01:17 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eSo, right now it's still very much a prototype
01:18 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eBut I have just constructed a DIY vaporizor
01:19 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eI took that 2-liter bottle I had, taped a paper towel roll to the top, then moulded a bunch of foil (with a lot of excess for a giant bowl at the bottom) around it
01:19 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eSlid the foil off, dropped some weed in, and slid it back on
01:19 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eAnd Then I just hold it with the lighter like 3-5 inches below the foil bowl
01:19 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eIt heats the weed and gives off the THC without all the smoke
01:20 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eIt's not airtight but for the most part the weed doesn't try to escape anyway
01:20 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eThen you just hit it from the hole in the bottom of the bottle (with it behing held upside down in the paper towel roll)(
01:21 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eConsidering that vaporizors are insanely expensive I think this is a good way
01:21 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eI didn't even find this on the internet or anything!
01:22 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eThe only issues right now are: holding it gets hot as the heat rises, and over time the heat passes through and begins the singe the paper towel roll
01:22 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g ePVC to the rescue, methinks
01:24 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eYeah...
01:24 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eThat's exactly what I'll do
01:24 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g ePVC as a stand and the pipe
01:25 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eWith the top of the pipe ending with the female part for a 2L to screw into
01:25 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eThe bottom somehow easily prepared for foil bowls
01:25 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eThen a hose that I can just stab into a 2L
01:25 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eTo suck from
01:25 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eThis could be a party device
01:26 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eAnd the best part is the foil bowl means it's not directly paraphenalia since really there won't be any weed in/on it
01:26 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eBad part about that is you throw away the resin
01:54 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eA hot plate instead of a lighter
01:56 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eNo, a candle
01:56 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eInstead of PVC though...aluminum
01:56 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eTo easily withstand the heat
01:57 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eFoil bowls
01:57 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eHanging above the candle
01:57 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eAnd releasing upward into the screwed in 2L
01:57 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eWith a hose coming out of hte top
01:57 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eOr maybe a turkey bag
01:58 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eDamn it this is going to be epic
01:59 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eI'm thinking of maybe someway of like using a glass top with multiple hoses like a hooka
01:59 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eA vapo-hooka!
02:02 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eAlright
02:02 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eAluminmum stand
02:02 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eWith a base
02:02 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eAnd above that a hanging bowl system
02:03 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eNot decided there, maybe an aluminum bowl or maybe a whole for foil bowls
02:03 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eA candle sits on the base, flame under bowl, and the vapors rise up into the chamber, which will have multiple stems
02:03 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eWooo fuck yeah

15:30 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eYou're talking to a geek about something that eliminates everything a geek likes about a computer / linux
15:30 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eRapes the HTTP protocol for its own agenda
15:31 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eMoves the processing off of my computer, where I want it, and onto my internet connection, which is of course no where near as stable as my computer
15:32 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eNot to mention the massive privacy concerns that I already have with my somewhat limited google usage, which would pale in comparison to using a google OS
15:33 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eOf course this is just my opinion
15:34 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eAnd I'm not saying it's not for anybody
15:34 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eBut it's definitely not for me
15:34 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eAnd it's fail.
15:39 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eAnd I remember what google wave does now
15:39 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eI don't remember the name of the site
15:39 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eBut yeah, like I said before it's definitely not a new idea

16:27 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eYou challenged me to tell you what it is, I said I couldn't even remember what wave does
16:27 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eI just checked, and I know for sure the service I'm thinking of existed long ago

01:18 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eI've found that your computer goes crazy when you can no longer read from /home
01:18 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eAt least applications do
01:18 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eI'm down to my last 1k files to transfer in this backup of 56k so I'll wait a bit before a reboot
01:19 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eBut I have a zfs pool running over 2 of the partitions I wasn't using
01:19 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eWhich is pointless because once this back up finishes I'll just use my disk
01:19 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eBut I'll be able to add more to my pool later :D
01:19 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eIt's basically running a RAID10 at FS level
01:20 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eSorry, RAID10 is an option but I chose whichever striping is for now

10:29 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eSo I've found that btrfs is about the same as ext3 in terms of performance
10:29 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eWith no large increase in CPU or RAM usage
10:29 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eIt has FS-level RAID0, 1, and 10
10:29 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eI'm doing 0, striped across a 400+500GB drive
10:42 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eSnapshots work, that's very cool
10:44 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eIt works like my rsync backup solution works
10:44 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eLazy copying
10:44 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eWhen you create a snapshot it just creates a copy of the entire FS tree as hardlinks
10:44 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eWhen something changes it writes to a new location on the drive
10:45 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eThe only downside is that since it's not a file-level copy but a tree-level copy the snapshot must reside on the btrfs pool

15:58:32|10.15.09 8/<g</CJg8/>g eDoes it have 2 counters with a net gain of 0?

18:19:48|10.15.09 8/<g</CJg8/>g eLooked it up
18:19:51|10.15.09 8/<g</CJg8/>g eIt's actually 0
18:19:55|10.15.09 8/<g</CJg8/>g eWhich is retarded
18:20:04|10.15.09 8/<g</CJg8/>g eNo other counter in the game is so ambiguous
18:20:21|10.15.09 8/<g</CJg8/>g eA luck counter can only be removed if an ability removes a "counter" of any type or a "luck counter"
18:20:34|10.15.09 8/<g</CJg8/>g eRemove a spore counter from a card with only a luck counter, for instance, wouldn't work
18:21:09|10.15.09 8/<g</CJg8/>g eBut according to the rules, the number of +/- 1 tokens on a card is equal to N where N is the difference between the two
18:21:46|10.15.09 8/<g</CJg8/>g eThe reason I asked is because of the persist ability
18:21:53|10.15.09 8/<g</CJg8/>g eYou can't return it if it had a -1/-1 counter on it already
18:22:09|10.15.09 8/<g</CJg8/>g eSo I figured that adding a +1/+1 counter to it wouldn't cancel that out
18:22:12|10.15.09 8/<g</CJg8/>g eBut apparently it does
18:25:01|10.15.09 8/<g</CJg8/>g eAnyway, I also found another combo
18:25:10|10.15.09 8/<g</CJg8/>g e4 card instant win...kinda lame but meh
18:25:13|10.15.09 8/<g</CJg8/>g eAlso mono color
18:25:24|10.15.09 8/<g</CJg8/>g eIt could be done easier in a multi-color deck but I was trying to make it mono white

18:26:35|10.15.09 8/<g</CJg8/>g eIt's actually not a good combo
18:26:58|10.15.09 8/<g</CJg8/>g eBecause it gives every other player a chance to go and they'll all be focused 100% on you because if they don't they'll lose
18:27:19|10.15.09 8/<g</CJg8/>g eOn the upside, if nobody counters it there's not much they can do because you just cleared the fucking board lol

22:12:52|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eEvery exploration increases the number of lands you can lay by 1, terramorphic expanse is a land that you can sac to landfall another land
22:13:00|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g ethat you can sac for 2 life and play again to yet again landfall
22:13:19|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eOr play the terramorphic expanse again and sac it again rather
22:13:38|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eThe whole reason the plains and forrests are there is for those lol
22:13:53|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g escapeshift is just a mass landfall rapeshaft buttfuck
22:15:00|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g esac 10 lands, search for 10 more, resulting in 10 +1/+1 counters on the vinelasher, 10 4/4 beasts from one of the baloths, the other baloth gets +40/+40, steppe lynx will get +20/+20
22:15:15|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eAll I need is something to give all my creatures haste
22:15:23|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eBut I'm using green so I doubt that'll happen
22:16:24|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eEven if not that's a 21/21, 46/46, and an 11/11
22:16:35|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eAssuming the vinelasher has no counters yet
22:17:49|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eAnd it could feasibly happen in like turn 5 or 6 or something
22:18:26|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g edryad arbor is a 1/1 land that's not a spell and is still a land.
22:18:29|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eThat's so awesome lol
22:19:45|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eI guess Akroma's memorial
22:19:57|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eI could just keep tapping the lands before I sac them and get that out relatively early
22:20:16|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g ePlus lotus cobra, shit forgot about that
22:20:25|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g elandfall - add one mana of any color to your mana pool
22:21:00|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eAssuming even one exploration I can landfall 4 times and end up with 6 mana in my pool
22:21:30|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eI'd only need 2 lands to start with a terramorphic expanse in my hand
22:21:46|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eand a*
22:24:30|10.26.09 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eSo I'm high and excited about my new deck

12:53:43|01.23.10 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eProbably morel ike 100
12:53:52|01.23.10 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g esomethings turned out to be a waste
12:55:03|01.23.10 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eThe most expensive parts are the pressure cooker and the spores
12:55:12|01.23.10 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eIf you can find a pressure cooker for cheap/free it'll save you money
12:55:19|01.23.10 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eOther than that look at the pictures I had in that guide
12:55:33|01.23.10 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g e3 tubs, piece of plexiglass, some tupperware cups, aquarium heater ($15 at walmart)
12:56:51|01.23.10 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eJars
12:57:01|01.23.10 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eChain, binder clips

12:57:17|01.23.10 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eAll of it can be purchased between home depot and walmart
12:57:52|01.23.10 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eAnd no I have no idea yet how much per cake per flush
12:57:56|01.23.10 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eNobody can give me a solid answer
12:58:06|01.23.10 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eSo I guess I'll just have to find out when they flush
12:59:13|01.23.10 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eAnd if you want to make the fruiting chamber automatic you need a case fan and someway to hook it up to a power source
12:59:16|01.23.10 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eSpinning really slowly
12:59:30|01.23.10 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eMount it so it keeps air moving through the fruiting chamber
12:59:46|01.23.10 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eI'm planning on just fanning it manually every day
13:05:38|01.23.10 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eThe thing you have to be careful about is that they need to be in total darkness and warm while they're in the jars
13:05:42|01.23.10 8/<g</CJ2g8/>g eAnd sterile
