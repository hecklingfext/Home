(Format: Year/Month/Day)

Changes for 0.4.0_alpha:
04/06/12
* Fixed a couple of build problems
* Generate lib/fluxspace/version.py from version.h
* Released as limited alpha for early adopters

Changes for 0.4.0:
04/02/12
* Switched to a version numbering scheme that can distinguish between minor and major revisions.
* Fix autoconf to handle Red Hat and static python library.
* Missing imlib2 is now a hard error.
* Made a few ./configure error messages clearer.
* Should (hopefully) have many fewer build issues.
* Created instant test environment.  After building run "runtest" and it creates a self-contained test directory.  The "runtest" script only copies newer files into the "test" hierarchy.  It won't overwrite modified files.
* The "files/start" script sets $HOME to force configuration to come from test/.fluxbox.
* The "fluxspace" script prepends "./lib" to the module search path, allowing the test environment to prefer modules placed in "test/lib".
* Installs to a self-contained directory, defaulting /usr/local/share/fluxspace, containing all Fluxspace components.  A softlink is created to /usr/local/bin/fluxspace.
* Support fluxlets that render to dockapp in the slit.
* New visual fluxlets include a clock, system CPU/memory/network meters and a general-purpose text displayer.
* Support "fluxfeeds".  These are processes that perform background updates through a new SOAP API to the fluxspace dockapp.  Two are provided, a multi-mailbox status meter and a stock quote retriever.

* Add script rox-add-app script to help maintain a Rox "menu" of sorts in
~/Apps.

* Clean up script handling and placement for the build process.
