Medium Priority

- Fluxlet: Drives/filesystems
- Fluxlet: CPU meter
- Fluxlet: Memory meter
- Fluxlet: Network meter
- Fluxlet: Top process meter/killer
- Fluxfeed: Weather
- Fluxfeed: Mail: POP3
- Fluxfeed: Mail: mbox
- Fluxfeed: Mail: Maildir
- IMAP: Mailbox options for calculating mail count differently.
    - E.g.  Inbox shows the new count, but a mailing list shows a
      total.
- Painter: Replace Imlib2 with FbTk (or GDK) for wallpaper display.
    - Get rid of dependency!
    - Current Esetroot code is unreliable!
- Robustness: Inject version number in Python module during build.
- Robustness: Better Fluxspace process management.
    - Make a true daemon.
    - Double-fork the process.
    - Redirect stdout/stderr.
- Robustness: Cleaner exits
    - Shutdown without killing.
    - Don't shutdown existing processes unless they are for the same
      user/display.
- Robustness: Logging
    - Catch and log all messages and errors.
    - Handle PyErr_Print.
    - Redirect stdout/stderr to the log file.

Low Priority

- Fluxlet: Main application menu
- Fluxlet: Workspace-targeted application menus
- Fluxlet: Analog clock
    - Requires drawing primitives.
- Fluxlet: Pager
    - Requires drawing primitives.
- Fluxlet: Mixer
    - Requires drawing primitives.
    - Requires sliders.
- Fluxlet: Graphical meters for CPU, Memory, Network, etc.
- Blank: Allow rendered/textured separators.
- Display: Dynamic rows.
    - E.g. Let filesystem fluxlet add and remove rows dynamically as
      filesystems come and go.
- Display: Drawing primitives.
    - Lines: various thicknesses, pens, etc.?
    - Rectangles: filled, unfilled, textured, etc.?
    - Circles/ellipses: filled, unfilled, textured, etc.?
	- Pixmap methods, e.g. load pixmap for handler (returns cookie),
	  display pixmap by cookie in row rectangle.
    - LEDs, e.g. for network transmit/receive.
	- Save drawing actions for automatic exposure handling.
	- Show wallpaper as backdrop for each mini-workspace.
- Display: Tooltips
    - Show customizable details for row(s).
- Input: More controls.
    - Sliders
- Robustness: Reduce memory consumption.
    - Switch to threads?
- Fluxlet: Reminders
	- Scan evolution and other PIMs for impending appointments.
	- Flash LED once a second when due.  Consider using a topmost
	  shaped window to get a show-through effect.
	- Display tooltip with more info.

- Installation: Convert to distutils?
