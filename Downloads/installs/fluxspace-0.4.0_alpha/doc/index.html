<H2><a name="description">Description</a></H2>
<P>Fluxspace enhances Fluxbox and similar
window managers by providing a framework for loading <A HREF="http://www.python.org/" TARGET="_top">Python
</A>modules with new workspace-oriented features. The framework
should make it easy to develop new modules with unforeseen
functionality. Modules using this framework can add event-driven
behavior to Fluxbox as an external component, without modifying
Fluxbox's C++ code.</P>
<P>Existing modules that integrate with
Rox Filer or Idesk can add effective desktop management to a pure
window manager, like Fluxbox. It goes beyond the normal desktop
capabilities to allow you to customize each workspace with its own
panels, desktop icons and running applets.</P>
<P>The C++ portion of the source code is
originally based on bbpager, which evolved to fluxter. It includes
code from Esetroot to perform the root window painting.</P>
<P>This is partly an experiment. I hope
you find it useful. But please let me know either way. :-)</P>

<H2><a name="motivation">Motivation</a></H2>
<P>The concept of workspaces is great. But
little rhyme, reason or guidance exists on the best way to use them.
This initial package is a big step towards making workspaces into
fully customizable task-oriented &quot;rooms&quot;.</P>
<P>You may change the way you use
workspaces and window managers. Or you may hate it. :)</P>
<P>Related tool icons can be grouped
together in different workspaces with single click access. This can
promote more consistent usage patterns and less window congestion. If
so, you will run into fewer situations where you have an urgent need
to reduce window clutter, and park windows somewhere/anywhere.</P>
<P>Windows will live in task-oriented
rooms. For example, your browser will tend to run in a different room
than your word processor. Using the &quot;rox&quot; module you may
have grouped the browser, email and ftp program icons on a panel in
one workspace, and your productivity applications on a panel in a
different workspace.</P>
<P>This release is just a starting point.
Hopefully the framework will grow in power, and new modules will be
developed. It need not be limited to workspace enhancements. See the
Future Possibilities section below.</P>
<H2><a name="benefits">Small Side Benefits</a></H2>
<P>You can make your Fluxbox life easier
by using Fluxspace to manage:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Startup applications.</P>
	<LI><P>Painting the wallpaper (no
	external app needed, just the imlib2 library). I.e. just specify the
	path to the image.</P>
</UL>
<H2><a name="caveats">Caveats</a></H2>
<H4>Inefficiency</H4>
<P>Fluxspace requires a Python
interpreter. It will consume more memory and run at interpreted
speeds.</P>
<P>I have seen a 4 MB memory overhead, but
little or no noticable performance degradation. In fact wallpaper
swapping is somewhat faster since a new process is not spawned for a
root command. A C library function is used instead.</P>
<P>Note that I do have a fast system. But
fluxspace currently only participates in major/infrequent events.
Hopefully the customization and enhancement ease will more than make
up for any inefficiency.</P>
<H4>User interface usage patterns that are not
universal</H4>
<P>The early feature set assumes you want
to use workspaces as task-centric rooms. If that's not your style you
may not benefit.</P>
<H4>Configuration</H4>
<P>For now you have to directly edit an
XML configuration file. XML is uglier and harder to edit than regular
flat text files. A graphical editor is on the wish list.</P>
<P>To compensate, the chosen XML grammar
is as simple and readable as possible.</P>
<H2><a name="starting">Getting Started</a></H2>
<H3>Check pre-requisites</H3>
<P>Verify that fluxbox, Imlib2, SWIG, Python, and whatever optional
programs you need, such as Rox Filer, are installed and working.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Fluxbox:
	http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net/</P>
	<LI><P>Imlib2: http://enlightenment.org/</P>
	<LI><P>SWIG: http://www.swig.org/</P>

</UL>
<P>All or most of these should be
available through the appropriate packaging mechanism provided by
distributions, such as Debian, Gentoo, Mandrake, RedHat, etc.</P>
<P>You will also need the development
packages for Imlib2 and Python in order to build.</P>
<H3>Installation (from source)</H3>
<H4>The whole build and install process in a
nutshell...</H4>
<PRE>$ ./configure
$ make
$ su -c make install</PRE><H4>
Notes</H4>
<P>It targets the /usr/local directory by
default. Modify the target directory with the &ndash;prefix= option
to ./configure.</P>
<P>Run the following to check for options
to view the possible configuration options:</P>
<PRE>$ ./configure --help</PRE><H3>
Advanced building</H3>
<H5>Cleaning down to pretty &quot;bare metal&quot;:</H5>
<PRE>$ make distclean</PRE><H5>
Cleaning down to really &quot;bare metal&quot;:</H5>
<PRE>$ make maintainer-clean</PRE><H5>
Starting from &quot;bare metal&quot;</H5>
<P>You need to run the bootstrap script:</P>
<PRE>$ ./bootstrap</PRE><H4>
Notes</H4>
<P>Fluxspace is packaged with some
pre-built components so that you shouldn't need to run the bootstrap
script. If you start playing with the SWIG interfaces you may need to
either manually delete fluxspace_wrap.cxx and fluxspace.py or run
&quot;make distclean&quot;. This forces the SWIG code to get
regenerated.</P>
<P>Running &quot;make distclean&quot; will
require the use of ./bootstrap to get going again.</P>
<H2><a name="testing">Testing</a></H2>
<P>You can test Fluxspace without installing it.</P>
<ul>
<li>Run <b>./testprep</b> to create or update the self-contained test environment in the <b>test</b> subdirectory.</li>
<li>Run <b>test/run</b> to run Fluxspace with a canned test configuration.</li>
<li>Run <b>test/debug</b> to run Fluxspace in a debugger.</li>
</ul>
<H2><a name="configuration">Configuration</a></H2>
<P>The following steps will get you quickly started.</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Copy fluxspace.xml from the
	examples directory (e.g. /usr/local/fluxspace/examples) to
	&quot;~/.fluxbox&quot;.</P>
	<LI><P>Edit fluxspace.xml with a text
	editor to customize it to your needs. The example has most features
	enabled or visible in the configuration. Almost everything should be
	changed for your environment, including paths to images, program
	lists, panel options, etc. Enable the modules you want by setting
	their &quot;enable&quot; attribute to &quot;yes&quot;. See the
	Configuration reference below. The sample file has everything
	disabled.</P>
	<LI><P>Replace or set the Fluxbox root
	command to &ldquo;fluxspace&rdquo;. You can find this setting in
	~/.fluxbox/init.</P>
	<LI><P>You may want to remove the
	starting of dockapps from the X initialization script (.xinitrc,
	.xsession, etc.) and add them to the fluxspace runner module
	configuration.</P>
	<LI><P>You should be ready to go.</P>
</OL>
<H3>Configuration File Format</H3>
<P>The following instructions assume you
understand XML syntax. In the future a graphical should be available.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The outer &lt;fluxspace&gt;
	element pair is mandatory.</P>
	<LI><P>Each module has an element with
	the module name as the tag. The only attribute is &quot;enable&quot;.
	Set &quot;enable&quot; to &quot;yes&quot; to load and use the
	module. Set &quot;enable&quot; to &quot;no&quot; to prevent it from
	loading.</P>
</UL>
<P>Packaged modules are documented below.</P>
<H3>Module: painter</H3>
<P>Displays wallpaper on each workspace.
Uses Enlightenment code. So most image formats are supported.
Pseudo-transparent terminals display correctly.</P>
<H4>Option: wallpaper</H4>
<P>One wallpaper option element should be
provided for each workspace.</P>
<H5>Attribute: workspace</H5>
<P>A number from 0 to n selecting the
workspace to receive the wallpaper.</P>
<H5>Attribute: image</H5>
<P>The path to the image displayed as the
wallpaper. '~' expansion is performed to substitute the full path to
the user home directory.</P>
<P>This attribute is required.</P>
<H5>Attribute: bgcolor</H5>
<P>The optional name of a background color
using standard X color names or RGB values.</P>
<P>You can use a tool like xcolors to
display the named colors. Standard RGB values are also excepted, e.g.
&quot;RGB:FF/00/00&quot; for bright red.</P>
<P>See X documentation for more
information.</P>
<H5>Attribute: scale</H5>
<P>If set to &quot;yes&quot; the image
stretches to the full screen size. This option can distort the
image's aspect ratio.</P>
<H5>Attribute: center</H5>
<P>If set to &quot;yes&quot; the image
appears centered on the screen. This option prevents image tiling.</P>
<H5>Attribute: fit</H5>
<P>If set to &quot;yes&quot; image
stretches to fill the screen as much as it can without changing the
aspect ratio.</P>
<H5>Attribute: mirror</H5>
<P>If set to &quot;yes&quot; some image
tiles flip to show a mirror image.</P>
<H3>Module: rox</H3>
<P>This module leverages Rox Filer to
display a different panel and or pinboard for each workspace.</P>
<P>Pinboards provide a surface for desktop
icons and allow Rox to paint background wallpaper.</P>
<P>Note that Rox pinboards duplicate the
functionality of the painter module for displaying wallpaper. So they
fight with each other to paint the desktop. They both lose. :)
Disable the painter module if you use Rox pinboards.</P>
<P>Check out the Rox documentation for all
of its capabilities. It's a great lightweight desktop and file
manager.</P>
<H4>Configuring Rox for Fluxspace</H4>
<P>IMPORTANT: Setting two Rox options will
improve coexistence with fluxbox.  Set these options as follows:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Run the Options dialog from the
	Rox context menu.</P>
	<LI><P>Select the Compatibility category.</P>
	<LI><P>Check: &quot;Override window
	manager control of the pinboard and panels&quot;.<BR>Note that this
	should become unnecessary when fluxbox fully supports the Extended
	Window Manager Hints standard.</P>
	<LI><P>Check: &quot;Pass all backdrop
	mouse clicks to window manager&quot;.</P>
</UL>
<H4>Option: panel</H4>
<P>Each workspaces get its own Rox panel.
Each workspace panel is individually customizable through normal Rox
mechanisms.</P>
<H5>Attribute: position</H5>
<P>Possible values are &quot;left&quot;,
&quot;right&quot;, &quot;top&quot; or &quot;bottom&quot; to select
the edge the panel occupies.</P>
<H4>Option: pinboard</H4>
<P>Each workspaces get its own Rox
pinboard to manage the desktop.  Each workspace desktop is
individually customizable through normal Rox mechanisms. Icons can be
added to access directories and for running programs. Wallpaper or a
colored background can also be specified through Rox.</P>
<P>There are no attributes for this
option.</P>
<P>IMPORTANT: Root menu mouse behavior
will suffer without patching either Fluxbox or Rox.  The Fluxbox root
menu immediately goes away when the mouse button is released on top
of a Rox pinboard.</P>
<P>Look for a link to a Fluxbox patch on
the Fluxspace web page.</P>
<P>A potentially better recommendation is
to avoid the pinboard entirely.  If you really want desktop icons,
use Idesk and the corresponding idesk module. Idesk does not have the
same issue because it doesn't interpose its own window for the
desktop background.  See below for a description of this module.</P>
<H3>Module: idesk</H3>
<P>The idesk module integrates with idesk
in a way that allows it to provide different desktop icons in each
workspace. The module manages a softlink to the current desktop and
restarts Idesk with each workspace change.  It effectively
reconfigures Idesk each time you enter a workspace.</P>
<P>This module requires no attributes or
options for the idesk module in fluxspace.xml. Simply adding a line
like the following to enable it:</P>
<PRE>&lt;idesk enable=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;</PRE><P>
Follow idesk's instructions concerning its initial configuration to
create your ~/.ideskrc file. Do NOT create an .idesktop directory!
The idesk fluxlet will dynamically create softlinks from
~/.fluxbox/idesktops/desktop(0-n) to ~/.idesktop. Desktop icon .lnk
files may be placed in the various ~/.fluxbox/idesktops/
subdirectories, e.g. desktop0 for the first workspace.</P>
<P>There may be some cosmetic repaint
issues with the desktop icons when you change workspaces with windows
obscuring desktop icons. Functionality is not affected. Hopefully
future releases will address this.</P>
<P>There are a couple of module attributes
that won't be important until future enhancements appear.</P>
<H5>Attribute: offsetx</H5>
<P>The number of pixels to shift the icon grid horizontally when
automatically creating icons.  The external tools
fluxspace-add-idesk-icon and fluxspace-sync-idesk-with-appdirs obey
this setting when placing new icons.</P>
<H5>Attribute: offsety</H5>
<P>The number of pixels to shift the icon grid vertically when
automatically creating icons.  The external tools
fluxspace-add-idesk-icon and fluxspace-sync-idesk-with-appdirs obey
this setting when placing new icons.</P>
<H3>Module: runner</H3>
<P>The runner module lets you specify
programs to run once or programs to start and stop on a per-workspace
basis.</P>
<P>Its simplest use is as a convenient
dockapp startup tool. More complex usage can set up applications to
provide unique functional environments for each workspace.  For
example, wmdrawer can be restarted with a different configuration
upon entering a workspace.  This will make different application
icons available for different desktops.  The same benefit can be
obtained by enabling per-workspace Rox panels or Idesk desktops. (see
above).</P>
<H4>Option: program</H4>
<P>Specifies a program to be executed by
the runner module at appropriate times.</P>
<P>If a workspace is specified the program
is run when entering the workspace and killed (gently) when leaving.</P>
<P>If the &quot;action&quot; is &quot;spawn&quot;
the program is not killed.</P>
<P>If a workspace is not specified the
program is only run at startup.</P>
<H5>Attribute: action</H5>
<P>Possible values are &quot;run&quot;
(the default) and &quot;manage&quot;. The difference is that managed
programs will be killed and restarted when leaving and entering
workspaces. Programs started with run are never stopped by Fluxspace.</P>
<P>This attribute is optional.</P>
<H5>Attribute: workspace</H5>
<P>The value is the workspace number, 0-n.
These programs will be monitored by the runner module. When entering
a new workspace running programs not assigned to the workspace are
killed and assigned programs are started.</P>
<P>When the workspace attribute is not
present programs are only run at startup and forgotten.</P>
<P>This attribute is optional.</P>
<H5>Attribute: command</H5>
<P>The value is a complete command to
execute, including all arguments.</P>
<P>No substitutions are performed.</P>
<H4>Module: tracer</H4>
<P>This modules enables event tracing to
standard output. There are no options. It is mainly useful as a
starting point for implementing new modules and for diagnostic
purposes.</P>
<H2><a name="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></H2>
<H3>Command Line Troubleshooting</H3>
<p>You will eventually want to configure Fluxspace to run from a hidden place,
like a startup script or the Fluxbox init configuration file.  If you experience
a failure of either a specific tool or Fluxspace itself return to the command
line for troubleshooting.</p>
<p>First stop Fluxspace, if it is still running.  Try "fluxspace stop" from the
command line.  If that doesn't halt Fluxspace and its managed applets work with
tools like ps, kill, top or your favorite graphical process manager.</p>
<p>Run "fluxspace" from the command line.  It will generally display
detailed error messages when things fail.  If that doesn't help try
running in verbose mode using "fluxspace -v".</p>
<H3>Python Module Import Problems</H3>

<p>
If you run Fluxspace from the command line module import problems
may look something like this:
</p>

<pre>
Traceback (most recent call last):=20
  File "/usr/local/bin/fluxspace", line 15, in ?=20
    import fluxspace=20
ImportError: No module named fluxspace
</pre>

<p>
Depending on your Python installation you may see this error for
modules other than "fluxspace".  The same concepts apply.  See where
the module is installed and configure Python to look for modules
in that directory.
</p>

<p> By default Fluxspace installs to /usr/local/lib/python2.x/site-packages.
Substitute the decimal digit of your Python version for ".x" in the path.  This
directory must be in Python's module load path.  You can create or add to a
PYTHONPATH environment variable, or you can edit or create a sitecustomize.py
file in /usr/lib/python2.x/site-packages.</p>

<p>
Please see <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.2.1/lib/module-site.html">
site -- Site-specific configuration hook</a> from the online Python
manual for more information and other possibilities.  Also check for a
site.py module, possibly under /etc/python2.x.  It may have instructions
and hooks for extending the Python load path.
</p>

<p>
A sitecustomize.py file could look something like this:
</p>

<pre>
import sys
version = '%d.%d' % (sys.version_info[0], sys.version_info[1])
addPath = '/usr/local/lib/python%s/site-packages' % version
    sys.path.insert(0, addPath)
</pre>

<p>
/usr/lib/python2.x/site-packages/sitecustomize.py is automatically
loaded by Python before loading other modules.  Substitute your
version digit for the 'x' in the python library root directory.
</p>

<p>
Another module import troubleshooting technique can be to run
Python interactively, i.e. execute the "python" command.  
When you see the "&gt;&gt;&gt; "
prompt, type "import fluxspace" (or whatever module is the problem)
and press Return.  You will probably see the same error as above.
</p>

<p>
As a diagnostic run the following commands.  Type the commands
preceded by "&gt;&gt;&gt; ".  Sample output is included for reference.
</p>

<pre>
  $ python
  Python 2.2.2 (#1, Dec 26 2002, 22:54:33)=20
  [GCC 3.2.1] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  &gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
  &gt;&gt;&gt; print sys.path
  ['', '/usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages', '/opt/debian/bin',
  '/usr/local/bin', '/home/scooper/bin', '/usr/lib/python2.2',
  '/usr/lib/python2.2/plat-linux2', '/usr/lib/python2.2/lib-tk',
  '/usr/lib/python2.2/lib-dynload', '/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages',
  '/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/gtk-2.0']
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Notice that '/usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages' is in the path.
Check that yours has what is needed to find the missing module.  If it
doesn't you may have to create or edit a sitecustomize.py file to add
your python library install path, e.g.
/usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages to the python path for loading
modules.
</p>

<H3>Failure to Import Fluxspace Binary Module</H3>

<p> Problems may occur when Fluxspace and Python are built with a different and
incompatible versions of the GCC/G++ compiler.  For example, you may see the
following error: </p>

<pre>
ERROR: Failed to import fluxspace binary module

Python error:
    /usr/local/lib/_fluxspace.so: undefined symbol: __cxa_pure_virtual
</pre>

<p>Please consider trying one or more of the following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install a more recent compiler version, if available.  Rebuild and reinstall Fluxspace.</li>

<li>Download and install the most recent stable Python version from http://www.python.org.</li>

<p>Note that some distributions, Red Hat in particular, require a specific
version of Python for their own tools.  Hence the new Python must get installed
in parallel.  The Red Hat packages available at Python.org will do this
automatically.  You may need to force the rebuild to use the newer Python.
Assuming the newest version is 2.3 the following should work.</p>

<pre>
        $ make clean
        $ PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.3 ./configure
        $ make
        $ make install
</pre>

<p>Also note that the main script, e.g. /usr/local/bin/fluxspace is generated to use the specific Python known by ./configure and make.  This solution has been tested to work on Red Hat 9.</p>

<li>Rebuild and reinstall Fluxspace after forcing the use of a different
      compiler version.  E.g. the following commands build with GCC 2.96 and
      then reinstall.</li>
<pre>
        $ make clean
        $ CC=gcc296 CXX=g++296 ./configure
        $ make
        $ make install
</pre>
<li>Reinstall Python from a source package that you rebuild with the currently-installed compiler.</li>
</ul>

<H2><a name="tools">Other Tools</a></H2>
<H3>fluxspacebg</H3>
<P>This tool simply runs Fluxspace in the background.  All command
line options are passed along to the fluxspace script.</P>
<H3>rox-add-app</H3>
<P>Usage: rox-add-app &lt;submenu&gt; &lt;command&gt; &lt;name&gt;</P>
<P>Creates a Rox AppDir under the ~/Apps directory hierarchy.  It
helps you manage a Start &ldquo;menu&rdquo; of sorts that is
accessible through Rox Filer browser windows.</P>
<H3>fluxspace-add-idesk-icon 
</H3>
<P>Usage: fluxspace-add-idesk-icon &lt;workspace #&gt; &lt;caption&gt;
&lt;command&gt; &lt;icon path&gt;</P>
<P>Creates an Idesk icon on a particular desktop.</P>
<H3>fluxspace-sync-idesk-with-appdirs</H3>
<P>Usage: fluxspace-sync-idesk-with-appdirs &lt;workspace #&gt;
&lt;directory&gt;</P>
<P>Generates Idesk desktop icons for the specified workspace based on
the Rox AppDir icons in the specified directory.  This gives you a
more graphical way to manage Idesk icons.  Otherwise you would have
to hand-edit .lnk text files.  To take advantage of this capability
maintain all icons using Rox tools and AppDir's.  Then run this tool
to populate your Idesk workspace desktops.</P>
<H2><a name="future">Future Possibilities</a></H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P>A graphical configuration
	editor.<BR>One possibility would allow modules to dynamically
	construct a master DTD that drives a fairly generic DTD-driven
	editor.</P>
	<LI><P>Manage a visible and expandable
	chunk of slit real estate, much like gkrellm. An API would allow
	modules to provide user interfaces including icon drawers, menus,
	meters, mailboxes, or whatever. Since modules will still receive
	workspace and window events the visible contact can adjust to the
	current workspace or active window.</P>
	<LI><P>Leverage standard window manager
	properties to tweak WM behavior more directly.</P>
	<LI><P>See if it makes sense to integrate
	more directly with a window manager, such as Fluxbox.</P>
	<LI><H3>Module Ideas:</H3>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>A sticky note module to attach
	drawings, text, etc. to particular windows, possibly based on the
	current workspace.</P>
	<LI><P>An arranger module would apply
	window tiling templates to workspaces. Window types could be
	assigned to sections of the tiling template. E.g. your browser and
	email program could always position themselves a certain way when
	opened on your &quot;Internet&quot; workspace.</P>
	<LI><P>A 3D effects module could provide
	lots of superflous effects to workspace transitions, window mapping,
	etc.</P>
