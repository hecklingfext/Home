=======================================================================

*** This is an experimental version of Fluxspace. ***

Please use it only if you are interested in testing, experimenting
with new features, and reporting problems.  It works fine for me on
one machine and in both Fedora and Debian.  Your mileage may vary.
Please contact me with suggestions, problems and questions.

The documentation has not been updated.  Please look at examples and
source for enlightenment or email me your questions.

New features:
    - Better build
    - Works with static python library
    - Supports slit meters similar to gkrellm.  The sample
      configuration enables a couple.
    - Supports timed events, allowing clocks, etc.
    - Please check the ChangeLog for a better list of enhancements.

Thanks for trying Fluxspace!

=======================================================================

Fluxspace is a tool to provide workspace hooks for extending Fluxbox
behaviors.  It provides a Python API and a set of useful modules, but
is also designed for easy module creation by other Python developers.

Author: Steve Cooper <stevencooper@isomedia.com>
    http://fluxspace.sourceforge.net/

Thanks to:

Henrik Kinnunen
    For fluxbox and the FbTk library used here for the slit meters.

John Kennis
    For writing bbpager

Brad Hughes
	For writing the Blackbox Window Manager (and with this a great deal 
	of the code for this application).

Nat Friedman with modifications by Gerald Britton
    For the Esetroot code used for displaying wallpaper


Build Dependencies
==================

python-dev >= 2.1
  Tested with python 2.2 and 2.3.
  http://www.python.org/download/
imlib2-dev
  http://enlightenment.org/
GNU build tools (automake, autoconf, libtool, aclocal, etc.)
  no known special version requirements
  http://www.gnu.org/

Optional Build Dependencies
===========================

These are only needed if "make distclean" is used to start from "bare
metal":

automake >= 1.5
autoconf >= 1.5
SWIG (for interfacing C++ to Python)

Runtime Dependencies
====================

fluxbox or other blackbox derivative
  Tested with fluxbox.  Untested with others.
  http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net/
python >= 2.1 (interpreter and core modules, with core XML support)
  http://www.python.org/download/
imlib2 (for setting the root background)
  http://enlightenment.org/

Optional Runtime Dependencies
=============================
rox (Rox Filer) - for the rox fluxlet.  Not required otherwise.
idesk (desktop icons) - for the idesk fluxlet.  Not required otherwise.

Getting Started
===============

1) Verify that fluxbox, Imlib2, SWIG, Python, and whatever optional
   programs you need, such as Rox Filer, are installed and working.
   
   Fluxbox:   http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net/
   Imlib2:    http://enlightenment.org/
   SWIG:      http://www.swig.org/
   Python:    http://www.python.org/
   Rox Filer: http://rox.sourceforge.net/
   idesk:     http://linuxhelp.hn.org/idesk.php

   All or most of these should be available through the appropriate
   packaging mechanism provided by distributions, such as Debian,
   Gentoo, Mandrake, RedHat, etc.

   You will also need the development packages for Imlib2 and Python
   in order to build.
   
2) Build and install fluxspace:

   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ su -c make install

   It targets the /usr/local directory try by default.  Run the
   following to check for options to change this directory, and other
   build parameters:

   $ ./configure --help

   To clean down to pretty "bare metal":

   $ make distclean

   To clean down to really "bare metal":

   $ make maintainer-clean

   Start from "bare metal" by running the bootstrap script:

   $ ./bootstrap

   Fluxspace is packaged with some pre-built components so that you
   shouldn't need to run the bootstrap script.  If you start playing
   with the SWIG interfaces you may need to either manually delete
   fluxspace_wrap.cxx and fluxspace.py or run "make distclean" to
   force the SWIG code to get regenerated.  Running "make distclean"
   will require the use of ./bootstrap to get going again.

3) Copy fluxspace.xml from the examples directory (e.g.
   /usr/local/fluxspace/examples) to "~/.fluxbox".

4) Edit fluxspace.xml with a text editor to customize it to your
   needs.  The example has most features enabled or visible in the
   configuration.  Almost everything should be changed for your
   environment, including paths to images, program lists, panel
   options, etc.  Enable the modules you want by setting their
   "enable" attribute to "yes".  See the Configuration reference
   below.  The example has everything disabled.

5) Add fluxspace to your X startup script, e.g. .xinitrc, .xsession,
   etc.  You may wish to remove the starting of dockapps from that
   script and add them to the fluxspace runner module configuration.

You should be ready to go.


Configuration
=============

The following assumes you understand XML syntax.  In the future this
will be edited graphically.

- The outer <fluxspace> element pair is mandatory.

- Each module has an element with the module name as the tag.  The
  only attribute is "enable".  Set "enable" to "yes" to load and use
  the module.  Set "enable" to "no" to prevent it from loading.

Modules are fully documented in the Fluxspace manual.  See
fluxspace-manual.html for more information.

Troubleshooting
===============

Please see the Fluxspace Manual (fluxspace-manual.html) for more
information.

FbTk Note
=========

Fluxspace uses the Fluxbox Toolkit (FbTk) found in the src/FbTk
directory of a Fluxbox source distribution.  The only necessary
changes are the following two made to FbTk/Makefile.am in order to
make the target binary a static library.

1) The following line:
     noinst_LIBRARIES = libFbTk.a
   must change to:
     noinst_LTLIBRARIES = libFbTk.la

2) The line beginning with:
     libFbTk_a_SOURCES = ...
   must change to:
     libFbTk_la_SOURCES = ...

That's it.  You should be able to copy src/FbTk from a recent Fluxbox,
make the above changes, and be ready to go.
