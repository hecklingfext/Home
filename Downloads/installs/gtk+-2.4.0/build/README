This directory contains various stuff that is used when building
software from the GNOME CVS (and dependent software) on uncommon
platforms. So far, it contains:

- makefile snippets and scripts used when building GLib, GTk+,
  and related software for Win32 with gcc or .with MSVC's command line
  tools, when not using the GNU auto*/configure/libtool mechanism

- some auxiliary scripts that are used when using libtool, for things
  that libtool doesn't handle currently.

- the <dirent.h> implementation from (the public domain) mingw
  runtime, separated for the benefit of MSVC builds.

In order to generate DLLs with version resources included (a nice
touch, and more Windows style), we need support for compiling and
including resources with DLL version number. Currently this knowledge
is not in libtool, but in the compile-resource and lt-compile-resource
scripts here in the win32 subdirectory.

(Originally, this directory was intended to be used by a build system
for GNOME, written in Python. See CVS for the original README
text. Apparently this concept never was taken into use, and this
directory hadn't been touched for two years, when I got the idea to
use this suitably named directory for another purpose. The original
author, Jay Painter, has okayed this.)
