- In some condition, Numlock + Function Keys don't work. Try to switch the Numlock key state.

- The GUI doesn't get translated (only messages). 
  Intended for the next version.
  
- Accentuated accents look like strange in the SDL window.
  This is an Assembly issue, so don't ask me about it.
  Characters are printed without their accent (french example: Activé -> Active)

- WAV Dumping is not (yet) implemented. GYM play back has not been completely tested.

- Analog joystick have not been completely tested.
  If someone reports it runs OK, we could remove this potential misfeature from the bug list.

- POV Hats are not yet supported.
