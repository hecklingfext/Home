Mono.Xna Contributing Guidelines
================================

1) Never decompile Microsoft binaries to see how they
   work. You cannot contribute if you've done this.

2) Create NUnit tests for everything that you can
   when contributing new code. All methods should be
   tested where possible. A seperate post will be
   written to explain how best to do that.

3) If someone says no, then no means no. They should
   give reasons why code isn't being accepted, if
   they don't, annoy them until they do. If reasons
   are given as to why code isn't being accepted, then
   the code will only be accepted once the relevant
   changes are made. Complaining about it won't help.

4) Have fun.
