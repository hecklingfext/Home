<b>3D-Desktop FX 0.2.4 (Initial Release) December 5, 2002</b><br>
<br>
3D-Desktop FX is an add-on for&nbsp;Brad Wasson's 3D-Desktop ( <a
 href="http://desk3d.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">http://desk3d.sourceforge.net</a>
) that includes shortcuts to start and stop 3D-Desktop, adds in several new
view settings (updated 3ddesktop.conf) and inludes a new script (3ddeskfx)
that allows you to call all of the old and new views, including the ability
to have a random mode or view each time you launch!<br>
<br>
This version of 3D-Desktop FX is 0.2.4 and was designed to work with 3D-Desktop
0.2.4.<br>
<br>
3D-Desktop FX was originally called "Random 3D-Desktop Generator" and was
designed to work with the default 3ddesktop.conf and act as a randomizer
for 3D-Desktop in that each time it was executed you would get a different&nbsp;3D-Desktop
mode or view.<br>
<br>
After some experimentation, it seemed that the current views weren't random
enough, or they produced unexpected results, so I added in 14 more views to
take advantage of all of the possible modes as well as all of the features
(including "breathing").<br>
<br>
Finally, I thought it would be a good idea to add in the ability for my script
to use a specific view each time, instead of a random view... &nbsp;but I
wanted it to be simple. &nbsp;In other words, I wanted to be able to simply
add one number to the end of my command line instead of having to remember
view names or constantly having to recheck my view names in my 3ddesktop.conf.
&nbsp;Granted, I might not remember which numbers force the different views,
but with a few minor number changes I will land on one that I like.<br>
<br>
The end result... &nbsp;3D-Desktop FX!<br>

<b>Installation</b><br>
<br>
This project requires Brad Wasson's 3D-Desktop ( <a
 href="http://desk3d.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">http://desk3d.sourceforge.net</a>&nbsp;)<br>
<br>
Make a backup copy of your ~./.3ddesktop/3ddesktop.conf !<br>
<br>
tar -zxvf 3ddeskfx.tgz<br>
cd 3ddeskfx<br>
mkdir ~/bin<br>
cp scripts/3ddeskfx ~/bin<br>
mkdir ~/.3ddesktop<br>
cp config/3ddesktop.conf to&nbsp;~/.3ddesktop<br>
<br>
You may need to add this to your ~/.bashrc file:<br>
<br>
export PATH=$PATH:~/bin<br>
<br>
Close all open terminals!<br>
<br>
After that, you should be able to run 3ddesfx in any terminal.<br>
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><br>
<b>Using 3D-Desktop FX</b><br>
<br>
Syntax:<br>
3ddeskfx [mode|view1|view2] [0..#]<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
3ddeskfx mode 4<br>
3ddeskfx view1 2<br>
3ddeskfx view2<br>
<br>
The first parameter is required and must be either "mode", "view1" or "view2".<br>
If the first parameter isn't included, the script will not run.<br>
<br>
The second parameter is not required.<br>
If the second parameter is included, the specified view # will run.<br>
If this parameter is not included, a random view # will run.<br>
<br>
Defaults<br>
<br>
If param1 is "mode", valid default ranges for param2 are 0 thru 5<br>
If param1 is "view1", valid default ranges for param2 are 0 thru 9<br>
If param1 is "view2", valid default ranges for param2 are 0 thru 13<br>
<br>
Note: &nbsp;The default ranges are based on the 3ddeskfx script. &nbsp;If
you add more views to that script, the ranges will be larger than shown above.<br>
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><br>
<b>Mode: &nbsp;3ddeskfx mode [0...5]<br>
<br>
</b>0 = Carousel, 1 = PriceIsRight, 2 = Cylinder<br>
3 = Viewmaster, 4 = Flip, 5 = Linear<br>
<b><br>
</b>If you don't include one of these numbers, 3D-Desktop will randomly pick
one for you!<br>
<b><br>
</b>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><br>
<b>View1: &nbsp;3ddeskfx view1 [0...9]</b><br>
<br>
Note: &nbsp;Using View1 requires either my 3ddesktop.conf or the original
config file from the 3D-Desktop project.<br>
<br>
0 = Default, 1 = Go Right, 2 = Go Left, 3 = Slide<br>
4 = ViewMaster, 5 = Linear, 6 = Linear Zip<br>
7 = Big Money, 8 = Linear (No Zoom), 9 = [SoD]Sgt-D<br>
<br>
8 is from the README (3ddesk --mode=linear --nozoom).<br>
9 is one I played with.&nbsp; ;)<br>
<br>
0 through 7 are defined in 3ddesktop.conf, 8 &amp; 9 are defined in 3ddeskfx.<br>
<br>
If you don't include one of these numbers, 3D-Desktop will randomly pick one
for you!<br>
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><br>
<b>View2 : 3ddeskfx view2 [0...13]</b><br>
<br>
Note: &nbsp;Using View2 requires my modified 3ddesktop.conf.<br>
<br>
0 = Carousel1 (Normal), 1 = Carousel2 (Breathing), 2 = Carousel3 (NoZoom)<br>
3&nbsp;= Cylinder1 (Normal), 4 =&nbsp;Cylinder2 (Breathing), 5 =&nbsp;Cylinder3
(NoZoom)<br>
6&nbsp;=&nbsp;PriceIsRight (Normal), 7 =&nbsp;PriceIsRight (Breathing), 8
=&nbsp;PriceIsRight (NoZoom)<br>
9 = Linear1 (Normal), 10 = Linear2 (NoZoom), 11 = ViewMaster1 (Normal)<br>
12 = ViewMaster2 (NoZoom), 13 = Flip (Normal)<br>
<br>
If you don't include one of these numbers, 3D-Desktop will randomly pick one
for you!<br>
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><br>
<b>Hacking</b><br>
<br>
You can add more views to your 3ddesktop.conf and then you can add more possibilities
to any of the 3 main sections in the 3ddeskfx script to utilize your new
views from your config file!<br>
<br>
Simply copy one of the existing #) lines in 3ddeskfx and paste in a new line
near the bottom of that section - or make as many as you want!<br>
<br>
Just remember, to get it to work perfectly random, you must increase the DVIEWS
in that section&nbsp; to match the total number of items in that section.<br>
<br>
Example...<br>
<br>
Say you add this to 3ddesktop.conf:<br>
<br>
view&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;MyViewMaster<br>
mode&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;viewmaster<br>
zoom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
1<br>
depth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5<br>
show_digit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br>
digit_size&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 25<br>
digit_color&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; red<br>
frame_color&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; red<br>
use_breathing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>
linear_spacing&nbsp;&nbsp; 0<br>
<br>
Then you could do this to the 3ddeskfx script under the "View2 Section":<br>
<br>
Change DVIEWS=14 to DVIEWS=15<br>
<br>
Add a line below this line: &nbsp;13) echo Flip ; 3ddesk --view=flip ;;<br>
<br>
Your new line would look like this: &nbsp;14) echo MyViewMaster ; 3ddesk --view=MyViewMaster
;;<br>
<br>
It's really not too hard once you get the hang of it. &nbsp;;)<br>
<br>
Q: &nbsp;What are all of the echos for?<br>
A: &nbsp;Feedback. &nbsp;When you run 3ddeskfx from the terminal it will tell
you what it is trying to do.<br>
<br>
If you are feeling risky, try making an entire section in 3ddeskfx just for
youself called MyViews.<br>
<br>
If you come up with better views than I have shown here, email them to me!
&nbsp;I could use the input!<br>
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><br>
<b>Server &amp; Settings</b><br>
<br>
The topmost section of 3ddeskfx is called "Server &amp; Settings"). &nbsp;This
is where you can setup the 3D-Desktop server.<br>
<br>
It will default to KDE3/Gnome2 unless you change it here.<br>
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><br>
<b>Shortcuts</b><br>
<br>
These folders contain pre-built shortcuts that you can use. &nbsp;So far,
only KDE3 and Gnome2 have been tested.<br>
<br>
The majority of these shortcuts only use 3ddesk and 3ddeskd and not my 3ddeskfx.<br>
<br>
The three shortcuts titled "Random..." (in the Main folder) all rely on my
3ddeskfx script.<br>
<br>
The Mode and View1 shortcuts all rely on either my 3ddesktop.conf or the original
config file from the 3D-Desktop project.<br>
<br>
The View2 shortcuts all rely on my modified 3ddesktop.conf.<br>

<b>Q &amp; A</b><br>
<br>
Q: &nbsp;I typed in 3ddeskfx, but nothing happened!?!<br>
A: &nbsp;Did you hit Enter?<br>
<br>
Q: &nbsp;Yes, smartass, I hit Enter!<br>
A: &nbsp;Heh, read the "Using 3D-Desktop FX" section above. &nbsp;You can't
just type 3ddeskfx, you have to include the word "mode", "view1" or "view2"
at least, and optionally you can include a valid number to prevent random
mode.<br>
<br>
Q: &nbsp;Ok, that still didn't work! &nbsp;:p<br>
A: &nbsp;As mentioned in the "Installation" section, 3D-Desktop FX requires
Brad Wasson's 3D-Desktop ( <a href="http://desk3d.sourceforge.net"
 target="_blank">http://desk3d.sourceforge.net</a>&nbsp;)<br>
<br>
Q: &nbsp;Bah! &nbsp;I'm still having problems!<br>
A: &nbsp;Ok, drop me a line! &nbsp;Use my email address below! &nbsp;;)<br>
