= Facebook Plug-In =

The included .so file is a library that will enable new and exciting
experiences on Facebook, such as an improved photo uploading
experience.

== License ==

Please see the included LICENSE file to review the license by which
this software is governed and important information regarding the
various open-source projects that are leveraged by this library.

== Requirements ==

Currently, we only officially support Firefox 3.0 or greater on
Ubuntu >= 8.04. (But it's likely it will work fine on many other
browsers, distros and configurations.)

== Installing ==

Installing the plugin is achieved by copying the included .so file
into the .mozilla/plugins folder in your home directory. For example,
if your username were "jzoidberg" you might copy the plugin to
"/home/jzoidberg/.mozilla/plugins". For your convenience, we have
included a script, "install.sh", that can be executed in lieu of
this rather technical operation.

Example:
  $ ./install.sh

== Technical Info ==

The Facebook Plug-In for Linux is currently distributed as a 32-bit
library for x86. In the future, we may release a 64-bit library,
and maybe even libraries for other architectures like ARM or PPC.
If you are interested in a build for a different platform, please
