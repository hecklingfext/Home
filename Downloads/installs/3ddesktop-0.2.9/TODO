WOULD BE NICE TO DO 
* RFE: "lock" the screen like xlock
* work with xinerama
* RFE: look for keyrelease event to trigger application exit (alexander stefanescu)
* background "image slurping" - small screen sections (per window?)
* split faces into tiles to lower texture size but keep resolution
* track timestamp on 3ddesktop.conf for reload efficiency
* encapsulate enums in classes
* add nifty OpenGL effects like blending and lighting
*   transparent faces (need to dynamically change them)
*   mirror surface below?
*   white flash
* RFE: option to reverse mouse wheel and buttons
* RFE: digits show in same plane as face
* RFE: support named desktops 
* RFE: support windowmaker desked names.
* RFE: move stuff around like in minority report (interactive)
* use ourPrintstring to show digits if digit texture didn't load
* support verticle areas in facesets other then linear
* support workspaces and viewports simultaneously
* gnome panel applet interface to change options etc
* make use of autoconf "HAVE_XXX" macros 
* sounds (SDL)
* patch desktop guide to run a program (3ddesk) to switch desktops
