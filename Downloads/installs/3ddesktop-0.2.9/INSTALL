3d-Desktop
----------

3d Desktop is a OpenGL program for switching virtual desktops in
a seamless 3-dimensional manner.  The default "visualization" maps
your screen onto an N-sided "carousel" which is rotated to select the
next screen.  When activated the current desktop appears to zoom out
so as to make your desktop appear to be actually in a 3d environment
with your other desktops.

The latest version of 3d-Desktop can be obtained from:

   http://desk3d.sourceforge.net/

Requirements
------------
  OpenGL/Mesa (Hardware acceleration is required)
  GLX
  XF86VidMode extensions
  Imlib2
  (The -devel components are necessary for compilation)


Installation
------------

    tar zxvf 3ddesktop-x.y.z.tar.gz
    ./configure
    make
    make install

Setup
-----

    3ddesk --acquire

This starts the 3ddeskd server and acquires an image of each of your
virtual desktops.  It will cycle through each desktop and return to
your current.


Running
-------

    bind a key combination to "/usr/bin/3ddesk"

    press the keys and BINGO!  3D sweetness :)
