Skippy-XD changelog

0.5.0 -- "Damage, Inc."
 - 'Lazy transparency' mode: let xcompmgr take care of alpha-blending the
   mini-windows.
 - Tooltip can have drop-shadow text, and can be translucent
 - Read config from ~/.skippy-xd.rc since the configuration options have
   changed
 - Branched from 'regular' skippy, switched from Imlib2 to XRender
   rendering, removed the old window snapshot code and replaced it with
   XComposite / XDamage stuff
